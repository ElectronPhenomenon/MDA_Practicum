Evidence posits that maintaining optimal brain health earlier in life is crucial for preventing and managing brain aging-related disorders such as dementia/cognitive decline, depression, stroke, and anxiety. We advocate for a holistic approach that integrates medical, psychological, and social frameworks with culturally tailored interventions across the lifespan to promote brain health and overall mental well-being in aging adults across all communities. Furthermore, our statement underscores the significance of prevention, early detection, and intervention in identifying cognitive decline, mood changes, and related mental illness. Action should also be taken to understand and address the needs of communities that traditionally have unequal access to preventive health information and services. By implementing culturally relevant and tailored evidence-based practices and advancing research in geriatric psychiatry, behavioral neurology, and geroscience, we can enhance the quality of life for older adults facing the unique challenges of aging. This position statement emphasizes the intrinsic link between brain health and mental health in aging, urging healthcare professionals, policymakers, and a broader society to prioritize comprehensive strategies that safeguard and promote brain health from birth through later years across all communities. The AAGP Expert Panel has the goal of launching further activities in the coming months and years.

Diabetes affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide, many of whom will develop life-threatening complications and die prematurely. Precision medicine can potentially address this enormous problem by accounting for heterogeneity in the etiology, clinical presentation and pathogenesis of common forms of diabetes and risks of complications. This second international consensus report on precision diabetes medicine summarizes the findings from a systematic evidence review across the key pillars of precision medicine (prevention, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis) in four recognized forms of diabetes (monogenic, gestational, type 1, type 2). These reviews address key questions about the translation of precision medicine research into practice. Although not complete, owing to the vast literature on this topic, they revealed opportunities for the immediate or near-term clinical implementation of precision diabetes medicine; furthermore, we expose important gaps in knowledge, focusing on the need to obtain new clinically relevant evidence. Gaps include the need for common standards for clinical readiness, including consideration of cost-effectiveness, health equity, predictive accuracy, liability and accessibility. Key milestones are outlined for the broad clinical implementation of precision diabetes medicine.

37784086|Rural libraries implementing walking groups or walking groups plus civic engagement for walkability in rural communities: a comparative effectiveness trial study protocol.|Perry, Cynthia K; Seguin-Fowler, Rebecca; Maddock, Jay E; Lenstra, Noah; Dieckmann, Nathan F; Currier, Jessica; Andreyeva, Elena; Winkle, Jim; Trost, Stewart G; |2023 10 02|Rural residents generally lack adequate physical activity to benefit health and reduce disparities in chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and certain cancers. The Socioecological Model describes physical activity as involving a dynamic and reciprocal interaction between individual, social, and community factors. Community group-based walking programs and civic engagement interventions aimed at enhancing physical activity have been successful in rural communities but have not targeted all three socioecological levels. Public libraries can act as innovative public health partners in rural communities. However, challenges remain because rural libraries often lack the capacity to implement evidence-based health promotion programming. The goals of this study are (1) build the capacity for rural libraries to implement evidence-based health promotion programs, (2) compare changes in physical activity between a group-based walking program and a combined group-based walking and civic engagement program with rural residents, and (3) conduct an implementation evaluation.

37751959|Integration of the social determinants of health into quality indicators for colorectal cancer surgery: a scoping review protocol.|Bondzi-Simpson, Adom; Ribeiro, Tiago; Benipal, Harsukh; Barabash, Victoria; Lofters, Aisha; Sutradhar, Rinku; Snyder, Rebecca A; Clarke, Callisia; Coburn, Natalie G; Hallet, Julie; |2023 09 26|Quality monitoring is a critical component of high-performing cancer care systems. Quality indicators (QIs) are standardised, evidence-based measures of healthcare quality that allow healthcare systems to track performance, identify gaps in healthcare delivery and inform areas of priority for strategic planning. Social structures and economic systems that allow for unequal access to power and resources that shape health and health inequities can be described through the social determinants of health (SDoH) framework. Therefore, granular analysis of healthcare quality through SDoH frameworks is required to identify patient subgroups who may experience health inequity. Given the high burden of disease of colorectal cancer (CRC) and well-defined cancer care pathways, CRC is often the first disease site targeted by health systems for quality improvement. The objective of this review is to examine how SDoH have been integrated into QIs for CRC surgery. This review aims to address three primary questions: (1) Have SDoH been integrated into the development, reporting and assessment of CRC surgery QIs? (2) When integrated, what measures and statistical methods have been applied? (3) In which direction do individual SDoH influence QIs outputs?

37515085|Adaptation and Formative Evaluation of Online Decision Support to Implement Evidence-Based Strategies to Increase HPV Vaccination Rates in Pediatric Clinics.|Shegog, Ross; Savas, Lara S; Frost, Erica L; Thormaehlen, Laura C; Teague, Travis; Steffy, Jack; Healy, Catherine Mary; Shay, Laura Aubree; Preston, Sharice; Vernon, Sally W; |2023 07 21|Human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination rates remain below national goals in the United States despite the availability of evidence-based strategies to increase rates. The Adolescent Vaccination Program (AVP) is a multi-component intervention demonstrated to increase HPV vaccination rates in pediatric clinics through the implementation of six evidence-based strategies. The purpose of this study, conducted in Houston, Texas, from 2019-2021, was to adapt the AVP into an online decision support implementation tool for standalone use and to evaluate its feasibility for use in community clinics. Phase 1 (Adaptation) comprised clinic interviews (n = 23), literature review, Adolescent Vaccination Program Implementation Tool (AVP-IT) design documentation, and AVP-IT development. Phase 2 (Evaluation) comprised usability testing with healthcare providers (HCPs) (n = 5) and feasibility testing in community-based clinics (n = 2). AVP-IT decision support provides an Action Plan with tailored guidance on implementing six evidence-based strategies (immunization champions, assessment and feedback, continuing education, provider prompts, parent reminders, and parent education). HCPs rated the AVP-IT as acceptable, credible, easy, helpful, impactful, and appealing (≥80% agreement). They rated AVP-IT supported implementation as easier and more effective compared to usual practice (p ≤ 0.05). The clinic-based AVP-IT uses facilitated strategy implementation by 3-month follow-up. The AVP-IT promises accessible, utilitarian, and scalable decision support on strategies to increase HPV vaccination rates in pediatric clinic settings. Further feasibility and efficacy testing is indicated.

It is accompanied by the document subtitled ""Methodology and Review of Evidence,"" which provides a detailed account of the methodology used for the evidence review. This guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework and specifically addresses the role of ESD versus EMR and/or surgery, where applicable, for the management of early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), and gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) and their corresponding precursor lesions. For ESCC, the ASGE suggests ESD over EMR for patients with early-stage, well-differentiated, nonulcerated cancer >15 mm, whereas in patients with similar lesions ≤15 mm, the ASGE suggests either ESD or EMR. The ASGE suggests against surgery for such patients with ESCC, whenever possible. For EAC, the ASGE suggests ESD over EMR for patients with early-stage, well-differentiated, nonulcerated cancer >20 mm, whereas in patients with similar lesions measuring ≤20 mm, the ASGE suggests either ESD or EMR. For GAC, the ASGE suggests ESD over EMR for patients with early-stage, well- or moderately differentiated, nonulcerated intestinal type cancer measuring 20 to 30 mm, whereas for patients with similar lesions <20 mm, the ASGE suggests either ESD or EMR. The ASGE suggests against surgery for patients with such lesions measuring ≤30 mm, whereas for lesions that are poorly differentiated, regardless of size, we suggest surgical evaluation over endoscopic approaches."

The Behavioral Science Committee (BSC) of the Children's Oncology Group (COG), comprised of psychologists, neuropsychologists, social workers, nurses, physicians, and clinical research associates, aims to improve the lives of children with cancer and their families through research and dissemination of empirically supported knowledge. Key achievements of the BSC include enhanced interprofessional collaboration through integration of liaisons into other key committees within COG, successful measurement of critical neurocognitive outcomes through standardized neurocognitive assessment strategies, contributions to evidence-based guidelines, and optimization of patient-reported outcome measurement. The collection of neurocognitive and behavioral data continues to be an essential function of the BSC, in the context of therapeutic trials that are modifying treatments to maximize event-free survival, minimize adverse outcomes, and optimize quality of life. In addition, through hypothesis-driven research and multidisciplinary collaborations, the BSC will also begin to prioritize initiatives to expand the systematic collection of predictive factors (e.g., social determinants of health) and psychosocial outcomes, with overarching goals of addressing health inequities in cancer care and outcomes, and promoting evidence-based interventions to improve outcomes for all children, adolescents, and young adults with cancer.

There is a critical need to provide evidence-based psychosocial care to parents and caregivers of children with cancer. Digital health interventions are important to address many barriers to in-person intervention delivery but are not widely used in pediatric psychosocial cancer care. The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the need for flexible, acceptable, and accessible psychosocial digital health interventions. The Electronic Surviving Cancer Competently Intervention Program (eSCCIP) is an innovative digital health intervention for parents and caregivers of children with cancer, delivered through a combination of self-guided web-based content and supplemented by 3 telehealth follow-up sessions with a trained telehealth guide. A Spanish language adaptation of eSCCIP, El Programa Electronico de Intervencion para Superar Cancer Competentemente (eSCCIP-SP), has been developed. The self-guided web-based cores of eSCCIP/eSCCIP-SP are a mix of didactic video content, multifamily video discussion groups featuring parents of children with cancer, and hands-on web-based activities.

Known risk variants explain only a small fraction of lung adenocarcinoma heritability. Here, we conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study of lung adenocarcinoma of East Asian ancestry (21,658 cases and 150,676 controls; 54.5% never-smokers) and identified 12 novel susceptibility variants, bringing the total number to 28 at 25 independent loci. Transcriptome-wide association analyses together with colocalization studies using a Taiwanese lung expression quantitative trait loci dataset (n = 115) identified novel candidate genes, including FADS1 at 11q12 and ELF5 at 11p13. In a multi-ancestry meta-analysis of East Asian and European studies, four loci were identified at 2p11, 4q32, 16q23, and 18q12. At the same time, most of our findings in East Asian populations showed no evidence of association in European populations. In our studies drawn from East Asian populations, a polygenic risk score based on the 25 loci had a stronger association in never-smokers vs. individuals with a history of smoking (Pinteraction = 0.0058). These findings provide new insights into the etiology of lung adenocarcinoma in individuals from East Asian populations, which could be important in developing translational applications.

C3I-funded centers implement evidence-based programs that offer various smoking cessation treatment components (e.g., counseling, Quitline referrals, access to medications). While evaluation of implementation outcomes in C3I is guided by evaluation of reach and effectiveness (via RE-AIM), little is known about technical efficiency-i.e., how inputs (e.g., program costs, staff time) influence implementation outcomes (e.g., reach, effectiveness). This study demonstrates the application of data envelopment analysis (DEA) as an implementation science tool to evaluate technical efficiency of C3I programs and advance prioritization of implementation resources.

One barrier to delivering evidence-based interventions in SUTS is providers' misconception that treating tobacco use and non-nicotine substance use concurrently jeopardizes clients' substance-use recovery, although research indicates that it enhances support for recovery and relapse prevention. A total of 86 treatment providers employed in SUTS (i.e., 9 Federally Qualified Health Centers, 16 Local Mental Health Authorities (LMHAs), 6 substance-use treatment programs in LMHAs, and 55 stand-alone substance-use treatment centers) in Texas, USA, answered survey questions about their (1) thoughts about treating tobacco during substance-use treatment, and (2) delivery of the 5A's tobacco-use intervention (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange). Twenty-six providers and leaders were interviewed about attitudes toward tobacco-free workplace policies and tobacco dependence and the relative importance of treating tobacco (vs. other substance-use disorders) at their center. Providers who did not believe tobacco use should be addressed as soon as clients begin treatment (i.e., endorsed responses of after 1 year, it depends on the client, or never) had lower odds of Asking clients about their tobacco use (OR = 0.195), Advising clients to quit smoking (OR = 0.176), and Assessing interest in quitting smoking (OR = 0.322). Qualitative results revealed barriers including beliefs that clients need to smoke to relieve the stress of substance-use recovery, are disinterested in quitting, fears that concurrent treatment would jeopardize substance use, and limited resources; additional training and education resources was the key facilitator theme. The results demonstrate a critical need to eliminate barriers to tobacco-treatment provision for clients in SUTS through education to correct misperceptions, specialized training to equip providers with knowledge and skills, and resources to build center capacity. Integrating evidence-based smoking interventions into routine care is key to support the recovery efforts of clients in SUTS.

The purpose of this study is to qualitatively examine the R = MC2 (Readiness = motivation × innovation specific capacity × general capacity) heuristic subcomponents in the context of implementing general and colorectal cancer screening (CRCS)-related practice changes in FQHCs. We conducted 17 interviews with FQHC employees to examine (1) experiences with successful or unsuccessful practice change efforts, (2) using approaches to promote CRCS, and (3) opinions about R = MC2 subcomponents. We conducted a rapid qualitative analysis to examine the frequency, depth, and spontaneity of subcomponents. Priority, compatibility, observability (motivation), intra- and interorganizational relationships (innovation-specific capacity), and organizational structure and resource utilization (general capacity) emerged as highly relevant. For example, organizational structure was described as related to an organization's open communication during meetings to help with scheduling procedures. The results contribute to understanding organizational readiness in the FQHC setting and can be helpful when identifying and prioritizing barriers and facilitators that affect implementation.

36925840|Applying Theory to Explain the Influence of Factors External to an Organization on the Implementation of an Evidence-Based Intervention.|Leeman, Jennifer; Wangen, Mary; Kegler, Michelle; Lee, Matthew; O'Leary, Meghan C; Ko, Linda K; Fernández, María E; Birken, Sarah A; |2022 05 26|Despite its widely acknowledged influence on implementation, limited research has been done on how the external environment (i.e., outer setting) determines when organizations adopt and implement new interventions. Determinant frameworks identify several outer setting-level factors such as funding streams, inter-organizational relationships, and peer pressure. However, these frameworks do not explain how or why outer-setting factors influence implementation. To advance research in this area, we argue for the importance of deriving theory-based propositions from organization theory to explain how outer setting factors influence organizations. Drawing on the work of the Organization Theory in Implementation Science (OTIS) project, we identified 20 propositions from five classic organization theories-Complexity Theory, Contingency Theory, Institutional Theory, Resource Dependence Theory, and Transaction Cost Economics. We then applied those propositions to hypothesize relationships among outer setting factors, implementation strategies, and implementation outcomes in five case studies of evidenced-based tobacco control interventions. The five case studies address the implementation of smoke-free policies, community health worker-led tobacco education and cessation programs, 5 A's (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, and Arrange), point-of-sale tobacco marketing policy interventions, and quitlines. The case studies illustrate how propositions may be used to guide the selection and testing of implementation strategies. Organization theories provide a menu of propositions that offer guidance for selecting and optimizing high-leverage implementation strategies that target factors at the level of outer setting. Furthermore, these propositions suggest testable hypotheses regarding the mechanisms underlying the influence of outer-setting factors on how and why organizations adopt and implement interventions.

Substance use treatment centers (SUTCs) do not commonly address their patients' tobacco use. Lack of knowledge on treating tobacco use with counseling and medication may be a barrier that underlies this inaction. A multi-component tobacco-free workplace program implemented in Texas SUTCs educated providers on treating tobacco use with evidence-based medication (or referral) and counseling. This study examined how center-level changes in knowledge from pre- to post-implementation (i.e., over time) affected center-level behavioral changes in providers' provision of tobacco use treatment over time. Providers from 15 SUTCs completed pre- and post-implementation surveys (pre N = 259; post N = 194) assessing (1) perceived barriers to treating tobacco use, specifically, a lack of knowledge on treating tobacco use with counseling or medication; (2) receipt of past-year education on treating tobacco use with counseling or medication; and (3) their intervention practices, specifically, the self-reported regular use of (a) counseling or (b) medication intervention or referral with patients who use tobacco. Generalized linear mixed models explored associations between provider-reported knowledge barriers, education receipt, and intervention practices over time. Overall, recent counseling education receipt was endorsed by 32.00% versus 70.21% of providers from pre- to post-implementation; the regular use of counseling to treat tobacco use was endorsed by 19.31% versus 28.87% from pre- to post-implementation. Recent medication education receipt was endorsed by 20.46% versus 71.88% of providers from pre- to post-implementation; the regular use of medication to treat tobacco use was endorsed by 31.66% versus 55.15% from pre- to post-implementation. All changes were statistically significant (ps < 0.05). High versus low reductions in the provider-reported barrier of ""lack of knowledge on pharmacotherapy treatment"" over time were a significant moderator of effects, such that SUTCs with high reductions in this barrier were more likely to report greater increases in both medication education receipt and medication treatment/referral for patients who use tobacco over time. In conclusion, a tobacco-free workplace program implementation strategy that included SUTC provider education improved knowledge and resulted in increased delivery of evidence-based treatment of tobacco use at SUTCs; however, treatment provision rates-in particular, offering tobacco cessation counseling-remained less than desirable, suggesting that barriers beyond lack of knowledge may be important to address to improve tobacco use care in SUTCs. Moderation results suggest (1) differences in the mechanisms underlying uptake of counseling education versus medication education and (2) that the relative difficulty of providing counseling versus providing medication persists regardless of knowledge gains."

However, there is a paucity of data on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), distress, and health behaviors in long-term myeloma survivors who are in stable remission after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT). In this cross-sectional study using data from 2 randomized controlled trials of survivorship care plans and internet-based self-management intervention in transplantation survivors, the primary objective was to measure HRQoL (using the Short Form-12, version 2.0 [SF-12 v2]), distress (using the Cancer- and Treatment-Related Distress [CTXD] instrument), and health behaviors of myeloma survivors in stable remission after AHCT. A total of 345 patients at a median of 4 years (range, 1.4 to 11 years) post-AHCT were included. The mean SF-12 v2 Physical Component Summary (PCS) score was 45.5 ± 10.5, and the mean Mental Component Summary (MCS) score was 51.3 ± 10.1, compared with US population norms of 50 ± 10 for both (P < .001 and P = .021 for PCS and MCS comparisons, respectively). Notably, neither reached the threshold for a minimal clinically important difference. Approximately one-third of the patients had clinically significant distress based on the CTXD total score, with distress reported by 53% of the patients in the Health Burden domain, by 46% in the Uncertainty domain, by 33% in the Finances domain, by 31% in the Family Strain domain, by 21% in the Identity domain, and by 15% in the Medical Demands domain. Preventive care guidelines were adhered to by 81% of the myeloma survivors; however, adherence to exercise and diet guidelines were relatively low, at 33% and 13%, respectively. Myeloma AHCT survivors in stable remission have no clinically meaningful worsening in physical functioning compared with the general population. Survivorship programs should address ongoing distress due to health burden, uncertainty, and finances in myeloma survivors, along with evidence-based targeted interventions for modifiable health behaviors, such as nutrition and exercise.

In the absence of interventions for e-cigarette cessation, we sought to understand how and why e-cigarette users attempt to quit on their own. Participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online crowdsourcing platform. Those who reported they had ever used e-cigarettes regularly and had attempted to quit e-cigarette use were eligible for participation. Measures included demographic characteristics, other tobacco product use, e-cigarette device characteristics, barriers to quitting e-cigarettes, and facilitators to quitting e-cigarettes. A content analysis was conducted on twotwo open-ended questions that asked about advice respondents had for others trying to quit vaping and resources they wished they had during their quit attempt. Descriptive analyses were performed (means/standard errors; frequencies/proportions). A total of 89.0% reported using an e-cigarette with nicotine, 20.2% reported a nicotine concentration of 4-6 mg/mL%, 32.8% reported using multiple flavors, and 77.7% reported using their e-cigarette every day or some days. The primary reason reported for wanting to quit e-cigarettes was health concerns (42.2%), and 56.7% reported trying to quit ""cold turkey"". During quit attempts, 41.0% reported intense cravings and 53.1% reported stress as a trigger. From the content analysis, the most commonly cited suggestion for those wanting to quit e-cigarettes was distractions/hobbies (19.9%), followed by reducing/tapering down nicotine (16.9%). Descriptive information on demographics, e-cigarette use, device characteristics, barriers, facilitators, and quit methods provides a first step in identifying factors that contribute to successful interventions designed for e-cigarette cessation."

We used visual analytics to examine complex relationships among aging stroke survivors' comorbidities. These findings informed pre-adaptation of a component of the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program. Methods: Secondary analysis of 2013-2014 Medicare claims with stroke as an index condition, hospital readmission within 90 days (n = 42,938), and 72 comorbidities. Visual analytics identified patient subgroups and co-occurring comorbidities. Guided by the framework for reporting adaptations and modifications to evidence-based interventions, an interdisciplinary team developed vignettes that highlighted multimorbidity to customize the self-management program. Results: There were five significant subgroups (z = 6.19, p < .001) of comorbidities such as obesity and cancer. We constructed 6 vignettes based on the 5 subgroups. Discussion: Aging stroke patients often face substantial disease-management hurdles. We used visual analytics to inform pre-adaptation of a self-management program to fit the needs of older adult stroke survivors.

A pathology community perspective."|Zhou, Ming; Amin, Ali; Fine, Samson W; Rao, Priya; Siadat, Farshid; Shah, Rajal B; |2022 11 23|"Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of Grade Group 1 (GG 1) prostate cancer remains a significant health care problem despite of its improved risk assessment and uptake in conservative management. Removing the cancer label from these non-lethal cancers has been proposed as an expedient way to reduce potential physical, psychological and financial harm to patients. Such a nomenclatural change necessitates a multidisciplinary team effort by clinicians and pathologists. Genitourinary Pathology Society recently conducted a survey of its members, gauging their awareness of this controversy and their position on whether GG 1 prostate cancer should be reclassified. Most respondents (196, 81.7%) opposed removing the cancer label from GG 1 cancer, 33 (13.8%) supported a change in nomenclature, while 11 (4.6%) responded that they were uncertain. Of those who supported the reclassification, 17 (51.5%) supported the change for radical prostatectomy only, 4 (12.1%) for biopsy only, and 12 (36.4%) for both biopsy and radical prostatectomy. This survey results highlight the gap between pathologists and clinicians in whether GG 1 prostate cancer should be labeled as ""non-cancer,"" and calls for continued debates and conversations between pathologists and clinicians, and further studies on the biology, diagnostic reproducibility, and ideal management of GG 1 prostate cancer in order to make a more evidence-based decision for patients."

We performed a narrative review of the available evidence supporting metastasectomy for M1b-c lesions in men diagnosed with oligometastatic or oligorecurrent PCa. The case series and case reports we identified indicate that surgical MDT is a safe and feasible treatment option for well-selected patients with a small number of PCa metastases diagnosed via molecular imaging. It is difficult to draw evidence-based conclusions regarding the survival benefit of metastasectomy; however, metastasectomy might lead to a prostate-specific antigen response and could potentially delay systemic therapy in patients with oligometastatic PCa. Prospective studies incorporating novel imaging are needed to better establish the role of metastasectomy for patients with metastatic PCa. PATIENT SUMMARY: We reviewed the evidence on surgical removal of prostate cancer lesions that have spread to the organs (eg, liver and lung) or bone, which are called metastases. Limited results show that this approach is feasible and has favorable outcomes in selected patients.
36361149|Providers' Non-Cigarette Tobacco Use Intervention Practices in Relation to Beliefs about Patients, Prioritization of and Skills for Intervention, and Referral Knowledge in Texas Healthcare Centers Providing Care to Persons with Behavioral Health Needs.|Jafry, Midhat Z; Reuven, Sean M; Britton, Maggie; Chen, Tzuan A; Martinez Leal, Isabel; Rogova, Anastasia; Kyburz, Bryce; Williams, Teresa; Patel, Mayuri; Reitzel, Lorraine R; |2022 11 01|Rates of non-cigarette (colloquially, other) tobacco use is elevated among adults with behavioral health conditions. Little is known about whether behavioral health providers are using brief interventions, including the evidence-based 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, and Arrange) for other tobacco use, or what provider factors may be associated with use of these interventions. The current study redressed this gap. Overall, 86 providers in Texas (9 Federally Qualified Health Centers, 16 Local Mental Health Authorities (LMHAs) that provide a broad range of mental and behavioral health services, 6 substance use treatment programs in LMHAs, and 55 stand-alone substance use treatment programs) took a survey assessing their beliefs regarding (1) patients' concerns about other tobacco use; (2) their desire to quit; (3) importance of intervening on other tobacco use with cessation counseling; (4) perceived skills to intervene; (5) knowledge of referral options for treatment. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the association between each factor and use of the 5As. Results showed that 70.9% of providers asked patients about other tobacco use status, 65.1% advised them to quit, 59.3% assessed quit interest, 54.7% assisted with a quit attempt, and 31.4% arranged a follow-up. Providers who believed patients were concerned about other tobacco use, recognized the importance of offering other tobacco use cessation counseling, believed they had the necessary skills to treat other tobacco use, and possessed knowledge of referral options, respectively, were more likely to deliver the 5As (ps < 0.05). Results add to a limited literature on provider intervention practices for other tobacco use in settings where behavioral health care is provided, highlighting the significance of provider beliefs, perceived skills, and referral knowledge to care delivery. Findings reveal opportunities to increase delivery of the 5As for other tobacco use to behavioral health patients and suggest provider factors that could be targeted to build this capacity.

A literature review was performed on the following topics: evidence-based transfusions of blood components and pharmaceutical agents. Other topics reviewed included perioperative coagulation assessment and perioperative PBM. The Transfusion and Anaemia Expertise Initiative (TAXI) consortium published a consensus statement addressing haemoglobin (Hb) transfusion threshold in multiple subsets of patients. A multicentre trial (PlaNeT-2) reported a higher risk of bleeding and death or serious new bleeding among infants who received platelet transfusion at a higher (50 000/μl) compared to a lower (25 000/μl) threshold. Recent data support the use of a restrictive transfusion threshold of 25 000/μl for prophylactic platelet transfusions in preterm neonates. The TAXI-CAB consortium mentioned that in critically ill paediatric patients undergoing invasive procedures outside of the operating room, platelet transfusion might be considered when the platelet count is less than or equal to 20 000/μl and there is no benefit of platelet transfusion when the platelet count is more than 50 000/μl. There are limited controlled studies in paediatric and neonatal population regarding plasma transfusion. Blood conservation strategies to minimise allogenic blood exposure are essential to positive patient outcomes neonatal and paediatric transfusion practices have changed significantly in recent years since randomised controlled trials were published to guide practice. Additional studies are needed in order to provide practice change recommendations.
36169917|Advances in Topical Treatments of Cutaneous Malignancies.|Algarin, Yanci A; Jambusaria-Pahlajani, Anokhi; Ruiz, Emily; Patel, Vishal A; |2022 09 28|Surgical excision has been the preferred treatment for cutaneous malignancies, but can be affected by various considerations. Noninvasive, self-administered topical treatments represent an alternative option. The aim of this review was to evaluate and summarize evidence-based recommendations for topical treatments of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), in situ melanoma (MIS), and extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD). Studies were reviewed on PubMed. Included studies were summarized, assessed for biases, and assigned a level of evidence to develop treatment recommendations. For the treatment of superficial BCC, complete clearance rates ranged from 90 to 93% for 5% 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and 71 to 76% for imiquimod (IMQ). For the treatment of nodular BCC, clearance rates for photodynamic therapy (PDT) were 91% at 3 months, with a sustained lesion clearance response rate of 76% after 5 years of follow-up. Clearance rates were 53 to 76% with IMQ. For squamous cell carcinoma in situ, clearance rates ranged from 52 to 98% for PDT, 67 to 92% for 5-FU, and 75 to 93% for IMQ. For MIS, clearance rates ranged from 53 to 92% for IMQ. For EMPD, 54% of 110 patients in cohort studies and case series had a clinical complete response with IMQ. While surgical intervention remains the standard of care for skin cancer, non-invasive, self-administered topical treatments are highly desirable alternative options. Ultimately, the patient and provider should find a treatment modality that aligns with the patient's expectations and maintenance of quality of life.
36149820|Prevention of device-related infections in patients with cancer: Current practice and future horizons.|Viola, George M; Szvalb, Ariel D; Malek, Alexandre E; Chaftari, Anne-Marie; Hachem, Ray; Raad, Issam I; |2022 09 23|Over the past several years, multifaceted advances in the management of cancer have led to a significant improvement in survival rates. Throughout patients' oncological journeys, they will likely receive one or more implantable devices for the administration of fluids and medications as well as management of various comorbidities and complications related to cancer therapy. Infections associated with these devices are frequent and complex, often necessitating device removal, increasing health care costs, negatively affecting quality of life, and complicating oncological care, usually leading to delays in further life-saving cancer therapy. Herein, the authors comprehensively review multiple evidence-based recommendations along with best practices, expert opinions, and novel approaches for the prevention of diverse device-related infections. The authors present many general principles for the prevention of these infections followed by specific device-related recommendations in a systematic manner. The continuous involvement and meaningful cooperation between regulatory entities, industry, specialty medical societies, hospitals, and infection control-targeted interventions, along with primary care and consulting health care providers, are all vital for the sustained reduction in the incidence of these preventable infections.

36054686|An evidence-based practice guideline of the National Society of Genetic Counselors for telehealth genetic counseling.|Green, Sarah; Hartzfeld, Deborah; Terry, Alissa Bovee; Fissell, Kristi; Friedman, Sue; Paolino, Nicholas; Principe, Kate; Sandbach, John; Trzupek, Karmen; Winheld, Stephanie; Malinowski, Jennifer; |2022 08 30|There are currently no practice guidelines available for genetic counseling using telehealth modalities. This evidence-based practice guideline was developed in response to increasing use of alternative service delivery models for genetic counseling, specifically telephone and video-based genetic counseling (telehealth genetic counseling or THGC). A recent systematic evidence review (SER) compared outcomes of THGC with in-person genetic counseling and found that for the majority of studied outcomes, THGC was a non-inferior and comparable service delivery model. The SER results were used to develop this guideline. The current and anticipated future use of THGC, including the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, provides the context for this guideline. Recommendation: The Telehealth Practice Guideline author workgroup conditionally recommends telehealth genetic counseling, either via telephone or video, as a delivery method for genetic counseling. Depending on factors unique to individual healthcare systems and provider and patient populations, THGC may be the only service delivery model available or may be utilized in addition to other service delivery models including in-person genetic counseling. The evidence shows large desirable effects, minor undesirable effects, and increased equity for patients when THGC is available. THGC may reduce or remove existing barriers to patient access to genetic counseling, such as medical conditions and/or disabilities that may affect a patient's ability to travel, inflexible work or school schedules, and lack of reliable transportation, finances, or dependent care. THGC is likely acceptable to key groups impacted by its use and is feasible to implement. Certain patient populations may require additional resources or encounter more barriers in using telemedicine services in general. For these populations, THGC can still be a valuable option if solutions are available.

Yet, a gap remains on how to adapt evidence-based vaccine interventions for the in vivo competitive social media messaging environment and what strategies to employ to make vaccine messages go viral. Push-pull and RE-AIM dissemination frameworks guided our adaptation of a National Cancer Institute video-based HPV vaccine cancer control program, the HPV Vaccine Decision Narratives, for the social media environment. We also aimed to understand how dissemination might differ across three platforms, namely Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter, to increase reach and engagement. Centering theory and a question-answer framework guided the adaptation process of segmenting vaccine decision story videos into shorter coherent segments for social media. Twelve strategies were implemented over 4 months to build a following and disseminate the intervention. The evaluation showed that all platforms increased following, but Instagram and TikTok outperformed Twitter on impressions, followers, engagement, and reach metrics. Although TikTok increased reach the most (unique accounts that viewed content), Instagram increased followers, engagement, and impressions the most. For Instagram, the top performer, six of 12 strategies contributed to increasing reach, including the use of videos, more than 11 hashtags, COVID-19 hashtags, mentions, and follow-for-follow strategies. This observational social media study identified dissemination strategies that significantly increased the reach of vaccine messages in a real-world competitive social media messaging environment. Engagement presented greater challenges. Results inform the planning and adaptation considerations necessary for transforming public health HPV vaccine interventions for social media environments, with unique considerations depending on the platform.

Consequently, it is important that centers providing health care to this group mandate providers' use of tobacco screenings to inform the need for tobacco use disorder intervention. This study examined the prevalence of mandated tobacco screenings in 80 centers providing health care to Texans with behavioral health needs, examined key factors that could enhance screening conduct, and delineated providers' perceived barriers to tobacco use intervention provision. The results indicated that 80% of surveyed centers mandated tobacco use screenings; those that did were significantly more likely than those that did not to have a hard stop for tobacco use status in health records and were marginally more likely to make training on tobacco screening available to providers. The most widespread barriers to tobacco use disorder care provision were relative perceived importance of competing diagnoses, lack of community resources to refer patients, perceived lack of time, lack of provider knowledge or confidence, and belief that patients do not comply with cessation treatment. Overall, the results suggest that there are opportunities for centers providing care to Texans with behavioral health needs to bolster their tobacco screening and intervention capacity to better address tobacco-related health disparities in this group. Health care centers can support their providers to intervene in tobacco use by mandating screenings, streamlining clinical workflows with hard stops in patient records, and educating providers about the importance of treating tobacco with brief evidence-based intervention strategies while providing accurate information about patients' interest in quitting and providers' potential impacts on a successful quit attempt.

35766902|Envisioning clinical trials as complex interventions.|Stensland, Kristian D; Damschroder, Laura J; Sales, Anne E; Schott, Anne F; Skolarus, Ted A; |2022 06 29|Clinical trials are critical components of modern health care and infrastructure. Trials benefit society through scientific advancement and individual patients through trial participation. In fact, billions of dollars are spent annually in support of these benefits. Despite the massive investments, clinical trials often fail to accomplish their primary aims and trial enrollment rates remain low. Prior efforts to improve trial conduct and enrollment have had limited success, perhaps due to oversimplification of the complex, multilevel nature of trials. For these reasons, the authors propose applying implementation science to the clinical trials context. In this commentary, the authors posit clinical trials as complex, multilevel evidence-based interventions with significant societal and individual benefits yet with persistent gaps in implementation. An application of implementation science concepts to the clinical trials context as means to build common vocabulary and establish a platform for applying implementation science and practice to improve clinical trial conduct is introduced. Applying implementation science to the clinical trials context can augment improvement efforts and build capacity for better and more efficient evidence-based care for all patients and trial stakeholders throughout the clinical trials enterprise.

Optimal patient management requires an understanding of cognitive effects of the disease and its treatment and an efficacious approach to assessment and management of cognitive dysfunction, including selection of treatments to minimize the risk of cognitive impairment. Awareness is increasing of the potentially detrimental effects of cancer-related cognitive dysfunction on functional independence and quality of life. Prostate cancer occurs most often in older men, who are more likely to develop cognitive dysfunction than younger individuals; this population may be particularly vulnerable to treatment-related cognitive disorders. Prompt identification of treatment-induced cognitive dysfunction is a crucial aspect of effective cancer management. We review the potential etiologies of cognitive decline in patients with prostate cancer, including the potential role of androgen receptor pathway inhibitors; commonly used tools for assessing cognitive function validated in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and adopted in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer trials; and strategies for management of cognitive symptoms. Many methods are currently used to assess cognitive function. The prevalence and severity of cognitive dysfunction vary according to the instruments and criteria applied. Consensus on the definition of cognitive dysfunction and on the most appropriate approaches to quantify its extent and progression in patients treated for prostate cancer is lacking. Evidence-based guidance on the appropriate tools and time to assess cognitive function in patients with prostate cancer is required.

35326482|On the Cutting Edge of Oral Cancer Prevention: Finding Risk-Predictive Markers in Precancerous Lesions by Longitudinal Studies.|Crawford, Madeleine; Johnson, Eliza H; Liu, Kelly Y P; Poh, Catherine; Tsai, Robert Y L; |2022 03 18|Early identification and management of precancerous lesions at high risk of developing cancers is the most effective and economical way to reduce the incidence, mortality, and morbidity of cancers as well as minimizing treatment-related complications, including pain, impaired functions, and disfiguration. Reliable cancer-risk-predictive markers play an important role in enabling evidence-based decision making as well as providing mechanistic insight into the malignant conversion of precancerous lesions. The focus of this article is to review updates on markers that may predict the risk of oral premalignant lesions (OPLs) in developing into oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs), which can logically be discovered only by prospective or retrospective longitudinal studies that analyze pre-progression OPL samples with long-term follow-up outcomes. These risk-predictive markers are different from those that prognosticate the survival outcome of cancers after they have been diagnosed and treated, or those that differentiate between different lesion types and stages. Up-to-date knowledge on cancer-risk-predictive markers discovered by longitudinally followed studies will be reviewed. The goal of this endeavor is to use this information as a starting point to address some key challenges limiting our progress in this area in the hope of achieving effective translation of research discoveries into new clinical interventions.

As well as breast cancer, a spectrum of atypical epithelial proliferations (atypia) can also be detected as part of screening. This spectrum of changes, while not cancer, may mean that a woman is more likely to develop breast cancer in the future. Follow-up of atypia is not evidence based. We currently do not know which atypia should be detected to avoid future cancer. This study will explore how atypia develops into breast cancer in terms of number of women, time of cancer development, cancer type and severity, and whether this varies for different types of atypia.

Community-engaged dissemination and implementation research (CEDI) emphasizes engaging stakeholders (e.g., community members, practitioners, community organizations, etc.) with diverse perspectives, experience, and expertise to provide tacit community knowledge regarding the local context, priorities, needs, and assets. Importantly, CEDI can help improve health inequities through incorporating unique perspectives from communities experiencing health inequities that have historically been left out of the research process. The community-engagement process that exists in practice can be highly variable, and characteristics of the process are often underreported, making it difficult to discern how engagement of community partners was used to improve implementation. This paper describes the community-engagement process for a multilevel, pragmatic randomized trial to increase the reach and impact of evidence-based tobacco cessation treatment among Community Health Center patients; describes how engagement activities and the resulting partnership informed the development of implementation strategies and improved the research process; and presents lessons learned to inform future CEDI research.

Too often implementation never or slowly occurs. The community-wide campaign intervention Tu Salud ¡Si Cuenta! has evidence of improving health outcomes related to chronic disease among low-income, Latinos. Using the RE-AIM Framework, this study examined if the scaled-up version of the intervention is associated with improvements in hypertension and obesity in 12 locations. Each element of the RE-AIM framework was examined. For ""Effectiveness,"" we examined outcomes overall and by implementing location. We used linear and logistic regression to assess if exposure in the intervention was associated with improvement in hypertension and weight loss. Participants were stratified into ""low exposure"" (2-3 outreach visits) vs. ""high exposure"" (4-5 outreach visits). Based on the RE-AIM Framework, the intervention ""reached"" its intended population of low-income Latinos, demonstrated ""effectiveness"" in improving hypertension and obesity, was ""adopted"" at a high level in all but one site, was ""implemented"" with fidelity to the intervention model with moderate success across locations, and showed high ""maintenance"" over time. For effectiveness specifically, we found that out of 5,019 participants, 2,508 (50%) had a baseline hypertensive blood pressure (BP) reading. Of the 2,508, 1,245 (49.9%) recovered to normal blood pressure or pre-hypertension stage by last follow-up. After adjusting for baseline BP and potential confounders in multivariable linear regression models, the high exposure group had significantly more reduction in systolic BP (adjusted mean difference in % change = -0.96; p = 0.002) and diastolic BP (adjusted mean difference in % change = -1.61; p < 0.0001) compared to the low exposure group. After controlling for baseline weight and other confounders, the high exposure group had significantly greater decrease in weight compared to the low exposure group (adjusted mean difference in % change = -1.28; p < 0.0001). Results from the multivariable logistic regression models indicated that compared to the low exposure group the high exposure group was more likely to achieve a clinically significant minimum 5% weight loss [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.97; p < 0.0001). This study contributes evidence that a Community-Wide Campaign model holds promise for addressing hypertension and obesity among low-income Latinos."
34822118|Implementation of an Evidence-Based Intervention with Safety Net Clinics to Improve Mammography Appointment Adherence Among Underserved Women.|Holcomb, Jennifer; Rajan, Suja S; Ferguson, Gayla M; Sun, Jiali; Walton, Gretchen H; Highfield, Linda; |2021 11 25|The Peace of Mind Program is an evidence-based intervention to improve mammography appointment adherence in underserved women. The aim of this study was to assess effectiveness of the intervention and implementation of the intervention in safety net clinics. The intervention was implemented through a non-randomized stepped wedge cluster hybrid study design with 19 Federally Qualified Health Centers and charity care clinics within the Greater Houston area. A multivariable generalized estimating equation logistic regression was conducted to examine mammography appointment adherence. A survey assessing Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research constructs was also conducted with clinic staff prior to adoption and eight weeks post implementation. One-sided t-tests were conducted to analyze mean score changes between the surveys. A total of 4402 women (baseline period = 2078; intervention period = 2324) were included in the final regression analysis. Women in the intervention period were more likely to attend or reschedule their mammography appointment (OR = 1.30; p < 0.01) than those in the baseline period receiving usual care. Women who completed the intervention were more likely to attend or reschedule their mammography appointment than those who did not complete the intervention (OR = 1.62; p < 0.01). The mammography appointment no-show rates for those in the baseline period, in the intervention period, and who completed the intervention were, respectively, 22%, 19%, and 15%. A total of 15 clinics prior to adoption and eight clinics completed the survey at 8 weeks post implementation A statistically significant mean score decrease was observed in Inner Setting and in two Inner Setting CFIR constructs, Culture-Effort, and Implementation Climate. While the intervention improved mammography appointment adherence, there are opportunities to further integrate Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research constructs. Trial registration: Clinical trials registration number: NCT02296177.

The partnership implemented four strategies to improve the adoption and scale-up of evidence-based interventions with Federally Qualified Health Centers and charity care clinics: (1) an outreach email blast targeting the community partner member clinics to increase program awareness, (2) an adoption video encouraging enrollment in the program, (3) an outreach webinar educating the community partner member clinics about the program, encouraging enrollment and outlining adoption steps, and (4) an adoption survey adapted from Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research constructs from the Cancer Prevention and Control Research Network for cancer control interventions with Federally Qualified Health Centers. The development of academic-community partnerships can lead to successful adoption of evidence-based interventions particularly in safety net clinics.

Several COVID-19 vaccines have received emergency use authorisations from the US Food and Drug Administration, with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine receiving full approval on Aug 23, 2021. When paired with masking, physical distancing, and ventilation, COVID-19 vaccines are the best intervention to sustainably control the pandemic. However, surveys have consistently found that a sizeable minority of US residents do not plan to get a COVID-19 vaccine. The most severe consequence of an inadequate uptake of COVID-19 vaccines has been sustained community transmission (including of the delta [B.1.617.2] variant, a surge of which began in July, 2021). Exacerbating the direct impact of the virus, a low uptake of COVID-19 vaccines will prolong the social and economic repercussions of the pandemic on families and communities, especially low-income and minority ethnic groups, into 2022, or even longer. The scale and challenges of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign are unprecedented. Therefore, through a series of recommendations, we present a coordinated, evidence-based education, communication, and behavioural intervention strategy that is likely to improve the success of COVID-19 vaccine programmes across the USA.

34783664|Technology-Based Interventions for Cancer Caregivers: Concept Analysis.|Su, Zhaohui; Li, Xiaoshan; McDonnell, Dean; Fernandez, Andrea A; Flores, Bertha E; Wang, Jing; |2021 11 16|Cancer is a taxing chronic disease that demands substantial care, most of which is shouldered by informal caregivers. As a result, cancer caregivers often have to manage considerable challenges that could result in severe physical and psychological health consequences. Technology-based interventions have the potential to address many, if not all, of the obstacles caregivers encounter while caring for patients with cancer. However, although the application of technology-based interventions is on the rise, the term is seldom defined in research or practice. Considering that the lack of conceptual clarity of the term could compromise the effectiveness of technology-based interventions for cancer caregivers, timely research is needed to bridge this gap.

These effects may be closely intertwined and cause prolonged morbidity and decreased quality of life after HCT. Here we provide a systematic review of male-specific late effects in a collaboration among transplantation physicians, endocrinologists, urologists, dermatologists, and sexual health professionals through the Late Effects and Quality of Life Working Committee of the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research and the Transplant Complications Working Party of the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation. We used a systematic review methodology to summarize incidence, risk factors, screening, prevention, and treatment of these complications and provide consensus evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice and future research. Most of the evidence regarding male GVHD is still based on limited data, precluding strong therapeutic recommendations. Therefore, we recommend systematic screening for male genital GVHD regularly and reporting of cases to large registries to allow for a better understanding. Future research also should address treatment, given the little published evidence currently available. Male-specific endocrine consequences of HCT include hypogonadism, which also may affect bone health. Given the scanty evidence, current recommendations for hormone substitution and/or bone health treatment are based on similar principles as for the general population. Following HCT, sexual health decreases, and this topic should be addressed at regular intervals. Future studies should focus on interventional strategies to address sexual dysfunction. Infertility remains prevalent in patients having undergone myeloablative conditioning, warranting the offer of sperm preservation for all HCT candidates. Most studies on fertility rely on descriptive registry analysis and surveys, underscoring the importance of reporting post-HCT conception data to large registries. Although the quality of evidence is low, the development of cancer in male genital organs does not seem more prevalent in HCT recipients compared with the general population; however, subsequent malignancies in general seem to be more prevalent in males than in females, and special attention should be given to skin and oral mucosa. Male-specific late effects, which likely are more underreported than female-specific complications, should be systematically considered during the regular follow-up visits of male survivors who have undergone HCT. Care of patients with male-specific late effects warrants close collaboration between transplantation physicians and specialists from other involved disciplines. Future research should be directed toward better data collection on male-specific late effects and on studies about the interrelationships among these late effects, to allow the development of evidence-based effective management practices.

Patients in LMICs often rely on traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCIM) that is more familiar, less costly, and widely available. However, spheres of influence and tensions between conventional medicine and TCIM can further disrupt efforts in evidence-based cancer care. Integrative oncology provides a framework to research and integrate safe, effective TCIM alongside conventional cancer treatment and can help bridge health care gaps in delivering evidence-informed, patient-centered care. This growing field uses lifestyle modifications, mind and body therapies (eg, acupuncture, massage, meditation, and yoga), and natural products to improve symptom management and quality of life among patients with cancer. On the basis of this review of the global challenges of cancer control and the current status of integrative oncology, the authors recommend: 1) educating and integrating TCIM providers into the cancer control workforce to promote risk reduction and culturally salient healthy life styles; 2) developing and testing TCIM interventions to address cancer symptoms or treatment-related adverse effects (eg, pain, insomnia, fatigue); and 3) disseminating and implementing evidence-based TCIM interventions as part of comprehensive palliative and survivorship care so patients from all cultures can live with or beyond cancer with respect, dignity, and vitality. With conventional medicine and TCIM united under a cohesive framework, integrative oncology may provide citizens of the world with access to safe, effective, evidence-informed, and culturally sensitive cancer care.

This study aimed to compare disease outcomes of TUEB and cTURBT with focus on the different energy sources. Methods: A systematic search was performed using PubMed and Web of Science databases in June 2021. Studies that compared the pathological (detrusor muscle presence), oncological (recurrence rates) efficacy, and safety (serious adverse events [SAEs]) of TUEB and cTURBT were included. Random- and fixed-effects meta-analytic models and Bayesian approach in the network meta-analysis was used. Results: Seven randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and seven non-RCTs (NRCT), with a total of 2092 patients. The pooled 3- and 12-month recurrence risk ratios (RR) of five and four NRCTs were 0.46 (95% CI 0.29-0.73) and 0.56 (95% CI 0.33-0.96), respectively. The pooled 3- and 12-month recurrence RRs of four and seven RCTs were 0.57 (95% CI 0.25-1.27) and 0.89 (95% CI 0.69-1.15), respectively. The pooled RR for SAEs such as prolonged hematuria and bladder perforation of seven RCTs was 0.16 (95% CI 0.06-0.41) in benefit of TUEB. Seven RCTs (n = 1077) met our eligibility criteria for network meta-analysis. There was no difference in 12-month recurrence rates between hybridknife, laser, and bipolar TUEB compared with cTURBT. Contrary, laser TUEB was significantly associated with lower SAEs compared with cTURBT. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve ranking analyses showed with high certainty that laser TUEB was the best treatment option to access all endpoints. Conclusion: While NRCTs suggested a recurrence-free benefit to TUEB compared with cTURBT, RCTs failed to confirm this. Conversely, SAEs were consistently and clinically significantly better for TUEB. Network meta-analyses suggested laser TUEB has the best performance compared with other energy sources. These early findings need to be confirmed and expanded upon.

Patients treated with a qualifying therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer in the frontline setting meeting broad eligibility criteria were included to reflect the real-world population. Although a trend toward improved outcomes in patients receiving PD-(L)1 therapy over standard chemotherapy was observed in RWD analyses, the magnitude and consistency of treatment effect was more heterogeneous than previously observed in controlled clinical trials. The study design and analysis process highlighted the identification of pertinent methodological issues and potential innovative approaches that could inform the development of high-quality RWD studies.

Here, we assessed the performance of real-world overall survival (rwOS) from data sets sourced from EHRs by evaluating the ability of the end point to reflect expected differences from a previous randomized controlled trial across five data sources, after applying inclusion/exclusion criteria. The KEYNOTE-189 clinical trial protocol of platinum doublet chemotherapy (chemotherapy) vs. programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy (PD-1 combination) in first-line nonsquamous metastatic non-small cell lung cancer guided retrospective cohort selection. The Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator was used to calculate 12-month rwOS with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in each data source. Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and associated 95% CIs, controlled for prognostic factors. Once the inclusion/exclusion criteria were applied, the five resulting data sets included 155 to 1,501 patients in the chemotherapy cohort and 36 to 405 patients in the PD-1 combination cohort. Twelve-month rwOS ranged from 45% to 58% in the chemotherapy cohort and 44% to 68% in the PD-1 combination cohort. The adjusted HR for death ranged from 0.80 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.93) to 1.15 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.85), controlling for age, gender, performance status, and smoking status. This study yielded insights regarding data capture, including ability of real-world data to precisely identify patient populations and the impact of criteria on end points. Sensitivity analyses could elucidate data set-specific factors that drive results.

34431715|Real-world evidence for option value in metastatic melanoma.|Wong, William B; To, Tu My; Li, Meng; Lee, Woojung; Veenstra, David L; Garrison, Louis P; |2021 08 25|BACKGROUND: The concept of real option value (ROV) suggests there is added value in treatments that extend life because they enable a patient to live long enough to benefit from future innovative treatments. Real-world evidence of this novel value element is scant, limiting its consideration in formal value assessments. OBJECTIVE: To calculate the ROV in clinical practice of ipilimumab for treatment of advanced melanoma, with evaluation of survival until availability of cancer immunotherapy (CIT). METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of electronic health records from a US nationwide deidentified database including data from approximately 280 cancer clinics. Participants were patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma diagnosed after January 1, 2011, who initiated treatment before April 19, 2015, and were treated with first-line and second-line ipilimumab or chemotherapy, up to availability of CIT. The proportions of patients surviving and receiving CIT and overall survival by line of therapy were calculated. Baseline demographics were used to weight Kaplan-Meier curves using stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting. ROV was estimated for patients receiving first-line or second-line ipilimumab with or without subsequent CIT and first-line or second-line chemotherapy with or without subsequent CIT. RESULTS: Overall, 721 patients were included in the study, with a total sample size of 733 (12 patients in both groups). For first-line ipilimumab, 50% of patients survived to the availability of CIT, while only 18% of first-line chemotherapy users survived to the same date. For second-line ipilimumab, 37% of patients survived to availability of CIT vs 21% of patients using second-line chemotherapy. 45% of first-line ipilimumab and 52% of second-line ipilimumab patients who survived to the availability date received CIT. ROV for first-line ipilimumab averaged 3.7 months of additional survival, while those who initiated second-line ipilimumab averaged 4.8 months. The combined estimated ROV was 3.9 months. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides real-world evidence of ROV and adds to the growing literature that may support inclusion of this novel value concept for innovative therapies alongside more traditional measures of value. Further evaluation of ROV in clinical areas with varying survival and innovation is warranted. DISCLOSURES: This study was funded by Genentech, Inc., which was involved in conducting the study. Wong and To are employees of Genentech, Inc. Veenstra, Garrison, Li, and Lee have served as consultants to Genentech, Inc.

The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched in February 2021 for studies of patients with UR after RC. Incidence and risk factors of UR were the primary endpoints. The secondary endpoint was survival outcomes in patients who experienced UR. Twenty-one studies, comprising 9,435 patients, were included in the quantitative synthesis. Orthotopic neobladder (ONB) diversion was associated with a decreased probability of UR compared to non-ONB (pooled OR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.31-0.61, P < 0.001) and male patients had a significantly higher risk of UR compared to female patients (pooled OR: 3.16, 95% CI: 1.83-5.47, P < 0.001). Among risk factors, prostatic urethral or prostatic stromal involvement (pooled HR: 5.44, 95% CI: 3.58-8.26, P < 0.001; pooled HR: 5.90, 95% CI: 1.82-19.17, P = 0.003, respectively) and tumor multifocality (pooled HR: 2.97, 95% CI: 2.05-4.29, P < 0.001) were associated with worse urethral recurrence-free survival. Neither tumor stage (P = 0.63) nor CIS (P = 0.72) were associated with worse urethral recurrence-free survival. Patients with UR had a 5-year CSS that varied from 47% to 63% and an OS - from 40% to 74%; UR did not appear to be related to worse survival outcomes. Male patients treated with non-ONB diversion as well as patients with prostatic involvement and tumor multifocality seem to be at the highest risk of UR after RC. Risk-adjusted standardized surveillance protocols should be developed into clinical practice after RC.

34136136|Evaluating adults' health-related values and preferences about unprocessed red meat and processed meat consumption: protocol for a cross-sectional mixed-methods study.|Valli, Claudia; Howatt, Victoria; Prokop-Dorner, Anna; Rabassa, Montserrat; Johnston, Bradley C; Zajac, Joanna; Han, Mi Ah; Kenji Nampo, Fernando; Guyatt, Gordon H; Bala, Malgorzata M; Alonso-Coello, Pablo; |2020 05 11|Background: People need to choose from a wide range of foods, and in addition to availability and accessibility, people's values and preferences largely determine their daily food choices. Given the potential adverse health consequences of red and processed meat and the limited knowledge on individuals' health-related values and preferences on the topic, such data would be useful in the development of recommendations regarding meat consumption. Methods and analysis: We will perform a cross-sectional mixed methods study. The study population will consist of adult omnivores currently consuming a minimum of three weekly servings of either unprocessed red meat or processed meat. We will explore participants' willingness to stop or reduce their unprocessed red meat, or their processed meat consumption through a direct-choice exercise. This exercise will consist of presenting a scenario tailored to each individual's average weekly consumption. That is, based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of the best estimate of the risk reduction in overall cancer incidence and cancer mortality, we will ask participants if they would stop their consumption, and/or reduce their average consumption. We will also present the corresponding certainty of the evidence for the potential risk reductions. Finally, we will measure their meat consumption three months after the interview and determine if they have made any changes to their average consumption. Ethics and dissemination: The research protocol was approved by the ethics committees in Canada (Research Ethics Board, Dalhousie University), Spain (Comitè Ètic d'Investigació Clínica de l'IDIAP Jordi Gol), Poland (The Bioethics Committee of the Jagiellonian University), and Brazil (National Research Ethics Commission). The study is based on voluntary participation and informed written consent. Results from this project will be disseminated through publications and presentations.

Tobacco Use Disorder (TUD) is one of the most common substance use disorders in the world. Evidence-based treatment of TUD is effective, but treatment accessibility remains very low. A dearth of specially trained clinicians is a significant barrier to treatment accessibility, even within systems of care that implement brief intervention models. The treatment of TUD is becoming more complex and tailoring treatment to address new and traditional tobacco products is needed. The Council for Tobacco Treatment Training Programs (Council) is the accrediting body for Tobacco Treatment Specialist (TTS) training programs. Between 2016 and 2019, n = 7761 trainees completed Council-accredited TTS training programs. Trainees were primarily from North America (92.6%) and the Eastern Mediterranean (6.1%) and were trained via in-person group workshops in medical and academic settings. From 2016 to 2019, the number of Council-accredited training programs increased from 14 to 22 and annual number of trainees increased by 28.5%. Trainees have diverse professional backgrounds and work in diverse settings but were primarily White (69.1%) and female (78.7%) located in North America. Nearly two-thirds intended to implement tobacco treatment services in their setting; two-thirds had been providing tobacco treatment for 1 year or less; and 20% were sent to training by their employers. These findings suggest that the training programs are contributing to the development of a new workforce of TTSs as well as the development of new programmatic tobacco treatment services in diverse settings. Developing strategies to support attendance from demographically and geographically diverse professionals might increase the proportion of trainees from marginalized groups and regions of the world with significant tobacco-related inequities.

Stakeholders provide organizational specific adaptions in evidence-based interventions to ensure effective adoption, implementation, and sustainability. Stakeholder engagement strategies involve building mutual trust, providing clear communication, and seeking feedback. Using constructs from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and The International Association for Public Participation spectrum, a conceptual framework was created to guide stakeholder engagement in an evidence-based intervention to increase mammography appointment adherence in underserved and low-income women. A document review was used to explore the alignment of the conceptual framework with intervention activities and stakeholder engagement strategies. The results indicate an alignment with the conceptual framework constructs and a real-world application of stakeholder engagement in a mammography evidence-based intervention. The conceptual framework and stakeholder engagement strategies can be applied across a range of community-based cancer programs and interventions, organizations, and clinical settings.

At that time, there had been significant advances in the diagnosis, work-up, surgical management, and available treatment options allowing for more optimal care of affected women. Despite these advances, the incidence of endometrial cancer as well as the deaths attributable to the disease have continued to rise; from 1987 to 2014 there has been a 75% increase in cases and almost 300% increase in endometrial cancer deaths. Fortunately, since then, there has been progress in the treatment of patients with endometrial cancer with increased utilization of molecular pathology, greater understanding of genetic predisposition, enhanced methods for lymph node assessment, a broader understanding of the efficacy of radiation and chemotherapy, and a more efficient approach to survivorship and surveillance. The purpose of this document is to present a comprehensive review of this progress.

33482308|Opioids and cancer prognosis: A summary of the clinical evidence.|Ramirez, Maria F; Gorur, A; Cata, Juan P; |2021 01 19|Pain is a common and devastating symptom among cancer patients. It can be caused by the cancer itself or by certain therapies like surgery, radiation or chemotherapy. Opioids are the first line of treatment for moderate to severe cancer-related pain. Opioids alone or in combination with non-opioid analgesics and adjuvant medications are important components for pain management during the perioperative period for cancer patients. Opioids act on the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), which is expressed in cancer cells and non-malignant cells of the tumor microenvironment. Retrospective studies suggest an association between the expression of MOR in cancers and shorter survival. In addition, recent evidence suggests that opium use and prescription opioids can influence clinical oncological outcomes. In this review, we will summarize the clinical evidence regarding the effect of opioid administration and survival in patients with cancer as well as the current evidence involving MOR expression and cancer progression.

33440019|Volatile anaesthesia and peri-operative outcomes related to cancer: a feasibility and pilot study for a large randomised control trial.|Dubowitz, J A; Cata, J P; De Silva, A P; Braat, S; Shan, D; Yee, K; Hollande, F; Martin, O; Sloan, E K; Riedel, B; Riedel, B; |2021 01 13|Published data suggest that the type of general anaesthesia used during surgical resection for cancer may impact on patient long-term outcome. However, robust prospective clinical evidence is essential to guide a change in clinical practice. We explored the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial to investigate the impact of total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol vs. inhalational volatile anaesthesia on postoperative outcomes of patients undergoing major cancer surgery. We undertook a randomised, double-blind feasibility and pilot study of propofol total intravenous anaesthesia or volatile-based maintenance anaesthesia during cancer resection surgery at three tertiary hospitals in Australia and the USA. Patients were randomly allocated to receive propofol total intravenous anaesthesia or volatile-based maintenance anaesthesia. Primary outcomes for this study were successful recruitment to the study and successful delivery of the assigned anaesthetic treatment as per randomisation arm. Of the 217 eligible patients approached, 146 were recruited, a recruitment rate of 67.3% (95%CI 60.6-73.5%). One hundred and forty-five patients adhered to the randomised treatment arm, 99.3% (95%CI 96.2-100%). Intra-operative patient characteristics and postoperative complications were comparable between the two intervention groups. This feasibility and pilot study supports the viability of the protocol for a large, randomised controlled trial to investigate the effect of anaesthesia technique on postoperative cancer outcomes. The volatile anaesthesia and peri-operative outcomes related to cancer (VAPOR-C) study that is planned to follow this feasibility study is an international, multicentre trial with the aim of providing evidence-based guidelines for the anaesthetic management of patients undergoing major cancer surgery.
33292840|Development of a comprehensive measure of organizational readiness (motivation × capacity) for implementation: a study protocol.|Walker, Timothy J; Brandt, Heather M; Wandersman, Abraham; Scaccia, Jonathan; Lamont, Andrea; Workman, Lauren; Dias, Emanuelle; Diamond, Pamela M; Craig, Derek W; Fernandez, Maria E; |2020 11 11|Organizational readiness is important for the implementation of evidence-based interventions. Currently, there is a critical need for a comprehensive, valid, reliable, and pragmatic measure of organizational readiness that can be used throughout the implementation process. This study aims to develop a readiness measure that can be used to support implementation in two critical public health settings: federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and schools. The measure is informed by the Interactive Systems Framework for Dissemination and Implementation and R = MC2 heuristic (readiness = motivation × innovation-specific capacity × general capacity). The study aims are to adapt and further develop the readiness measure in FQHCs implementing evidence-based interventions for colorectal cancer screening, to test the validity and reliability of the developed readiness measure in FQHCs, and to adapt and assess the usability and validity of the readiness measure in schools implementing a nutrition-based program.
33275319|Treatment of Cancer-Associated Venous Thromboembolism with Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin or Direct Oral Anticoagulants: Patient Selection, Controversies, and Caveats.|O'Connell, Casey; Escalante, Carmen P; Goldhaber, Samuel Z; McBane, Robert; Connors, Jean M; Raskob, Gary E; |2020 12 04|The treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer is challenging because these patients have increased risks of both recurrent VTE and major bleeding, along with patient-specific and cancer-related factors that influence the approach to treatment. Historically, anticoagulant therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), given for both initial and long-term treatment, has been the preferred approach recommended by practice guidelines. Most recently, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines indicate that the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban are preferred for patients without gastric or gastroesophageal lesions. DOACs have been associated with an increased risk of major bleeding in patients with gastrointestinal and possibly genitourinary cancers, and DOACs should either not be used (especially in those with intact intraluminal tumors) or be used with caution in patients with these cancers. Fatal or life-threatening bleeding occurs with similar frequency with DOACs or LMWH, and most major bleeding with DOACs can be managed with transfusion and standard measures. The patient's willingness and ability to comply with LMWH injections, and their treatment preference, should also be considered. Patients with cancer who have VTE should be treated with anticoagulation for a minimum of 6 months. Anticoagulation should be continued indefinitely while cancer is active or under treatment or if there are persistent risk factors for recurrent VTE. This article summarizes the evidence from clinical trials of LMWH and DOACs that underpins the NCCN guideline recommendations, addresses several controversies and caveats regarding anticoagulant treatment, and offers evidence-based, practical suggestions on patient selection for treatment with DOACs. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Several randomized trials support the addition of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) to the therapeutic armamentarium for cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE). These agents come with unique risks and patient- and cancer-specific variables that must be evaluated during the course of a patient's cancer care. This narrative review discusses findings from clinical trials of low-molecular-weight heparin and DOACs for the treatment of cancer-associated VTE, evidence that supports the recent National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline recommendations. A personalized approach to treatment is proposed that addresses patient selection for treatment with DOACs, factors that influence efficacy and safety, controversies and caveats, and suggestions for their resolution in clinical practice.

33155097|Health Literacy Interventions in Cancer: a Systematic Review.|Housten, A J; Gunn, C M; Paasche-Orlow, M K; Basen-Engquist, K M; |2020 11 05|Approximately one-third of adults in the United States (U.S.) have limited health literacy. Those with limited health literacy often have difficultly navigating the health care environment, including navigating care across the cancer continuum (e.g., prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment). Evidence-based interventions to assist adults with limited health literacy improve health outcomes; however, little is known about health literacy interventions in the context of cancer and their impact on cancer-specific health outcomes. The purpose of this review was to identify and characterize the literature on health literacy interventions across the cancer care continuum. Specifically, our aim was to review the strength of evidence, outcomes assessed, and intervention modalities within the existing literature reporting health literacy interventions in cancer. Our search yielded 1036 records (prevention/screening n = 174; diagnosis/treatment n = 862). Following deduplication and review for inclusion criteria, we analyzed 87 records of intervention studies reporting health literacy outcomes, including 45 pilot studies (prevention/screening n = 24; diagnosis/treatment n = 21) and 42 randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental trials (prevention/screening n = 31; diagnosis/treatment n = 11). This literature included 36 unique interventions (prevention/screening n = 28; diagnosis/treatment n = 8), mostly in the formative stages of intervention development, with few assessments of evidence-based interventions. These gaps in the literature necessitate further research in the development and implementation of evidence-based health literacy interventions to improve cancer outcomes.

Evidence-based interventions have been identified to improve the uptake of CPC behaviors; however, they are often inconsistently implemented, affecting their reach and effectiveness. Patient navigation is an evidence-based approach to increasing CPC behaviors. Nevertheless, there are few navigation programs that use systematically developed implementation strategies to facilitate adoption, implementation, and maintenance, which affects uptake and outcomes. This article describes the development of a multifaceted implementation strategy designed to facilitate delivery of a CPC phone navigation program to increase breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening; human papillomavirus vaccination; and smoking cessation among 2-1-1 Texas helpline callers. Using implementation mapping, a systematic approach for developing implementation strategies, we designed a strategy that involved training 2-1-1 information specialists to deliver the program, developed online tracking and quality-monitoring (audit and feedback) systems, and developed and distributed protocols and other materials to support training and implementation. Through this iterative process and our collaboration with 2-1-1 Texas call centers, our project resulted in a comprehensive training program with a robust curriculum of pertinent program content, for which we identified core components and appropriate delivery modes that are culturally relevant to the population. The results of this study can be applied to the development of more systematic, transparent, and replicable processes for designing implementation strategies. The study also demonstrates a process that can be applied to other contexts and other CPC program implementation efforts.

However, direct comparative data are not available to inform treatment decisions and/or guideline recommendations. Therefore, we performed network meta-analysis to indirectly compare the efficacy and safety of currently available treatments. Multiple databases were searched for articles published before June 2020. Studies that compared overall and/or metastasis-free and/or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival (OS/MFS/PSA-PFS) and/or adverse events (AEs) in nmCRPC patients were considered eligible. Three studies (n = 4117) met our eligibility criteria. Formal network meta-analyses were conducted. For MFS, apalutamide, darolutamide, and enzalutamide were significantly more effective than placebo, and apalutamide emerged as the best option (P score: 0.8809). Apalutamide [hazard ratio (HR): 0.85, 95% credible interval (CrI): 0.77-0.94] and enzalutamide (HR: 0.86, 95% CrI: 0.78-0.95) were both significantly more effective than darolutamide. For PSA-PFS, all three agents were statistically superior to placebo, and apalutamide emerged as the likely preferred option (P score: 1.000). Apalutamide (HR: 0.71, 95% CrI: 0.69-0.74) and enzalutamide (HR: 0.76, 95% CrI: 0.74-0.79) were both significantly more effective than darolutamide. For AEs (including all AEs, grade 3 or grade 4 AEs, grade 5 AEs, and discontinuation rates), darolutamide was the likely best option. Apalutamide and enzalutamide appear to be more efficacious agents for therapy of nmCRPC, while darolutamide appears to have the most favorable tolerability profile. These findings may facilitate individualized treatment strategies and inform future direct comparative trials.

As we begin to recover from the pandemic, a cohesive international approach is needed, and guidance on how to resume endoscopy services safely to avoid unintended harm from diagnostic delays. The aim of these guidelines is to provide consensus recommendations that clinicians can use to facilitate the swift and safe resumption of endoscopy services. An evidence-based literature review was carried out on the various strategies used globally to manage endoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic and control infection. A modified Delphi process involving international endoscopy experts was used to agree on the consensus statements. A threshold of 80% agreement was used to establish consensus for each statement. 27 of 30 statements achieved consensus after two rounds of voting by 34 experts. The statements were categorised as pre-endoscopy, during endoscopy and postendoscopy addressing relevant areas of practice, such as screening, personal protective equipment, appropriate environments for endoscopy and infection control precautions, particularly in areas of high disease prevalence. Recommendations for testing of patients and for healthcare workers, appropriate locations of donning and doffing areas and social distancing measures before endoscopy are unique and not dealt with by any other guidelines. This international consensus using a modified Delphi method to produce a series of best practice recommendations to aid the safe resumption of endoscopy services globally in the era of COVID-19.

Heterogeneity in reporting study design elements and conducting statistical analyses is often observed for the same study design and study objective in medical literatures. Sometimes, researchers face a lot of predicaments using appropriate statistical approaches highlighted by methodologists for a specific study design either due to lack of accessibility or understanding of statistical methods or unavailability of checklists related to design and analysis in a concise format. The purpose of this review is to provide the checklist of statistical analysis and methods in biomedical research (SAMBR) to applied researchers.
32730111|Mental Health Outcomes in Adolescent and Young Adult Female Cancer Survivors of a Sexual Minority.|Desai, Milli J; Gold, Rebecca S; Jones, Chelsea K; Din, Hena; Dietz, Andrew C; Shliakhtsitsava, Ksenya; Martinez, Maria Elena; Vaida, Florin; Su, Hui-Chun Irene; |2020 07 27|Purpose: Sexual minority (SM) individuals experience higher rates of anxiety and depression. Previous research on mental health disparities for SM cancer survivors has largely focused on adult survivors; however, studies are limited in the adolescent and young adult (AYA) population. This study's objective is to compare depression and anxiety symptoms between AYA, female cancer survivors who identify as an SM and those who identify as heterosexual. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of 1025 AYA survivors aged 18-40 years (2015-2017) was performed. Patients self-reported SM identification and depression and anxiety symptoms, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ8) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD7), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression tested associations between SM identification and depression and anxiety. Results: Sixty-four participants (6%) identified as an SM. In adjusted analyses, SM participants had 1.88 higher odds of anxiety (odds ratio [OR] 1.88, confidence interval [95% CI] 1.05-3.35, p = 0.033) compared with heterosexual participants. SM participants did not have significantly higher odds of depression (OR 1.36, CI 0.75-2.47, p = 0.31). More social support was significantly associated with lower odds of depression (OR 0.91, CI 0.89-0.93, p < 0.001) and anxiety (OR 0.93, CI 0.91-0.94, p < 0.001). Conclusions: AYA cancer survivors identifying as an SM had nearly twice the odds of anxiety, with social support that is protective for both anxiety and depression. While mental health screening is recommended throughout the cancer care continuum, these data support the need for reliable screening, clinician awareness of increased vulnerability in the AYA, SM survivor population, and clinician training on culturally competent care and generation of evidence-based interventions.

Mailed fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) offers promise for increasing screening rates, but optimal strategies for implementation have not been well synthesized. In June 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened a meeting of subject matter experts and stakeholders to answer key questions regarding mailed FIT implementation in the United States. Points of agreement included: 1) primers, such as texts, telephone calls, and printed mailings before mailed FIT, appear to contribute to effectiveness; 2) invitation letters should be brief and easy to read, and the signatory should be tailored based on setting; 3) instructions for FIT completion should be simple and address challenges that may lead to failed laboratory processing, such as notation of collection date; 4) reminders delivered to initial noncompleters should be used to increase the FIT return rate; 5) data infrastructure should identify eligible patients and track each step in the outreach process, from primer delivery through abnormal FIT follow-up; 6) protocols and procedures such as navigation should be in place to promote colonoscopy after abnormal FIT; 7) a high-quality, 1-sample FIT should be used; 8) sustainability requires a program champion and organizational support for the work, including sufficient funding and external policies (such as quality reporting requirements) to drive commitment to program investment; and 9) the cost effectiveness of mailed FIT has been established. Participants concluded that mailed FIT is an effective and efficient strategy with great potential for increasing colorectal cancer screening in diverse health care settings if more widely implemented.

32500759|The clinical pharmacology of the medical treatment for overactive bladder in adults.|Mostafaei, Hadi; Shariat, Shahrokh F; Salehi-Pourmehr, Hanieh; Janisch, Florian; Mori, Keiichiro; Quhal, Fahad; Hajebrahimi, Sakineh; |2020 06 16|Overactive bladder is a prevalent symptom complex that affects the patient's quality of life. Any disruption between the neuronal micturition pathway can lead to bladder overactivity. Neurogenic causes, myogenic causes, aging, bladder outlet obstruction, sex, and psychological factors are some of the factors contributing to bladder overactivity. The complaint of any symptoms of OAB, which is highly prevalent and affects overall QOL, often needs therapeutic interventions. When conservative therapy methods fail, the addition of medications is recommended. The most commonly used agents for the treatment of OAB are antimuscarinic drugs. New classes of drugs, such as beta-3 agonists, have enriched our pharmacologic armamentarium.

Studies were deemed eligible if they compared cancer-specific survival in patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder with and without pretreatment laboratoryabnormalities. Formal meta-analyses were performed for this outcome. The systematic review identified 36 studies with 23,632 patients, of these, 32 studies with 22,224 patients were eligible for the meta-analysis. Several preoperative hematologic biomarkers were significantly associated with cancer-specific survival as follows: neutrophil - lymphocyte ratio (pooled hazard ratio [HR]: 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-1.29), hemoglobin (pooled HR: 0.87, 95% CI 0.82-0.94), C-reactive protein (pooled HR: 1.44, 95% CI 1.26-1.66), De Ritis ratio (pooled HR: 2.18, 95% CI 1.37-3.48), white blood cell count (pooled HR: 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.07), and albumin-globulin ratio (pooled HR: 0.26, 95% CI 0.14-0.48). Several pretreatment laboratory abnormalities in patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder were associated with cancer-specific mortality. Therefore, it might be useful to incorporate such hematologic biomarkers into prognostic tools for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. However, given the study limitations including heterogeneity and retrospective nature of the primary data, the conclusions should be interpreted with caution.

Selecting the appropriate therapy depends on the degree of field cancerization and the number of invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas. Other considerations include treatment efficacy, cost, side effects, and patient preference. Field therapies are preferred because they address clinically visible disease and subclinical atypia. However, lesion-directed therapies are useful for lesions that are more difficult to treat or those where a histologic diagnosis is required. Patients with extensive field cancerization benefit from a combination of field-directed and lesion-directed treatments. The second article in this continuing medical education series provides a framework to guide evidence-based decision making for field cancerization treatment.

32351923|Using Intervention Mapping to Develop Health Education and Health Policy Components to Increase Breast Cancer Screening and Chemotherapy Adherence Among Syrian and Iraqi Refugee Women in Beirut, Lebanon.|Sacca, Lea; Markham, Christine; Fares, Johny; |2020 04 15|Introduction: Despite the continuous increase in the incidence of metastatic breast cancer among Syrian and Iraqi refugee women residing in camp settings in Lebanon, mammography and chemotherapy adherence rates remain low due to multiple social, economic, and environmental interfering factors. This in turn led to an alarming increase in breast cancer morbidity and mortality rates among the disadvantaged population. Methods: Intervention mapping, a systematic approach which guides researchers and public health experts in the development of comprehensive evidence-based interventions (EBIs) was used to plan a health education and health policy intervention to increase breast cancer screening and chemotherapy adherence among Iraqi and Syrian refugee women aged 30 and older who are residing in refugee camps within the Beirut district of Lebanon. Results: The generation of the logic model during the needs assessment phase was guided by an extensive review of the literature and reports published in peer-reviewed journals or by international/local organizations in the country to determine breast cancer incidence and mortality rates among refugee women of Syrian and Iraqi nationalities. The underlying behavioral and environmental determinants of the disease were identified from qualitative and quantitative studies carried out among the target population and also aided in assessing the sub-behaviors related to the determinants of breast cancer screening and chemotherapy completion as well as factors affecting policy execution to formulate performance objectives. We then developed matrices of change objectives and their respective methods and practical applications for behavior change at the intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, and societal levels. Both educational components (brochures, flyers) and technological methods (videos disseminated via Whats app and Facebook) will be adopted to apply the different methods selected (modeling, self-reevaluation, consciousness raising, persuasion, and tailoring). We also described the development of the educational and technological tools, in addition to providing future implementers with methods for pre-testing and pilot-testing of individual and environmental prototype components. Conclusion: The use of intervention mapping in the planning and implementation of holistic health promotion interventions based on information collected from published literature, case reports, and theory can integrate the multiple disciplines of public health to attain the desired behavioral change.

In the last few decades, testing algorithms have been implemented to support an optimal risk-oriented therapy, leading to a large improvement in overall survival. In addition, large scale genomic studies have identified multiple aberrations of prognostic significance that are not routinely tested by existing modalities. However, as chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are increasingly used in clinical management of hematologic malignancies, these abnormalities may be more readily detected. In this article, we have compiled a comprehensive, evidence-based review of the current B-ALL literature, focusing on known and published subtypes described to date. More specifically, we describe the role of various testing modalities in the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic relevance. In addition, we propose a testing algorithm aimed at assisting laboratories in the most effective detection of the underlying genomic abnormalities.

32092844|The Healthy Cooking Index does not Predict the Carotenoid Content of Home-Cooked Meals.|Raber, Margaret; Basen-Engquist, Karen; Moran, Nancy E; Chandra, Joya; |2020 02 19|Home cooking programs are an increasingly popular approach to nutrition education and have the potential to promote diet quality among pediatric cancer survivors. A cornerstone of many programs is the use of fresh fruits and vegetables, which may support increased intake of many food components, including carotenoids, to improve survivor health. However, most dietary carotenoids in the United States currently come from processed vegetables, and it is unclear if the emphasis on fresh fruits and vegetables common in cooking education programs is associated with the total carotenoid content of meals. The objective of this analysis is to examine the relationship between fresh produce usage, practices commonly taught in healthy home cooking classes, and the carotenoid content of prepared meals among 40 parents with school-aged children. This is a secondary analysis of an observational study examining the quality of home cooking practices using an evidence-based index of behaviors, the Healthy Cooking Index (HCI). Nutrition-optimizing cooking practices, as quantified by the HCI, were not associated with the carotenoid content of meals (r = -0.24, p = 0.13). Further, total fruit and vegetable content of meals was not associated with total carotenoids (r = 0.14; p = 0.38), indicating heterogeneity in the carotenoid profiles of foods used by this population. High-carotenoid meals tended to use more canned and/or frozen tomato and vegetable products, and carotenoid content was associated with meals with sugar (r = 0.32; p = 0.04), and servings of refined grains (r = 0.49; p < 0.01). Our findings indicate an opportunity to educate pediatric cancer survivors and families on the incorporation of high-carotenoid food products while reducing refined grain and sweetener intake through a tailored home cooking intervention.

Community Health Centers (CHCs) are a key venue for reaching low SES populations with evidence-based tobacco cessation treatment such as Quitlines. Electronic health record (EHR)-based interventions at the point-of-care, text messaging (TM), and phone counseling have the potential to increase Quitline reach and are feasible to implement within CHCs. However, there is a lack of data to inform how, when, and in what combination these strategies should be implemented. The aims of this cluster-randomized trial are to evaluate multi-level implementation strategies to increase the Reach (i.e., proportion of tobacco-using patients who enroll in the Quitline) and Impact (i.e., Reach × Efficacy [efficacy is defined as the proportion of tobacco-using patients who enroll in Quitline treatment that successfully quit]) and to evaluate characteristics of healthcare system, providers, and patients that may influence tobacco-use outcomes.

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available literature on this topic and develop recommendations for optimal pain management after oncological breast surgery. A systematic review using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidance with procedure-specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) methodology was undertaken. Randomised controlled trials assessing postoperative pain using analgesic, anaesthetic or surgical interventions were identified. Seven hundred and forty-nine studies were found, of which 53 randomised controlled trials and nine meta-analyses met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Quantitative analysis suggests that dexamethasone and gabapentin reduced postoperative pain. The use of paravertebral blocks also reduced postoperative pain scores, analgesia consumption and the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Intra-operative opioid requirements were documented to be lower when a pectoral nerves block was performed, which also reduced postoperative pain scores and opioid consumption. We recommend basic analgesics (i.e. paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) administered pre-operatively or intra-operatively and continued postoperatively. In addition, pre-operative gabapentin and dexamethasone are also recommended. In major breast surgery, a regional anaesthetic technique such as paravertebral block or pectoral nerves block and/or local anaesthetic wound infiltration may be considered for additional pain relief. Paravertebral block may be continued postoperatively using catheter techniques. Opioids should be reserved as rescue analgesics in the postoperative period. Research is needed to evaluate the role of novel regional analgesic techniques such as erector spinae plane or retrolaminar plane blocks combined with basic analgesics in an enhanced recovery setting.

31678094|Incidence of abnormal cervical and vaginal cytology among women over age 65 years living with human immunodeficiency virus.|Stewart, Kelsey A; Allen, Stephanie M; Chesnokova, Arina E; Syed, Fatima; Levison, Judy E; |2019 10 31|Women with human immunodeficiency virus have higher rates of abnormal cervical and vaginal cytology and, subsequently, of cervical and vaginal cancers. Although professional bodies currently advocate for indefinite cytology screening for women living with human immunodeficiency virus, these recommendations are based on expert opinion, not evidence-based. In the general population, women who have never had an abnormal cytology result can cease screening at age 65 years. This is due to the relatively low incidence of dysplasia in this group and the risk of false-positive results as women age, invasive follow-up testing, and destructive treatments of lesions that are unlikely to progress to cancer. What is unclear, however, is how human immunodeficiency virus-infected women over age 65 years who have no history of abnormal cytology should be screened to maximize benefit while reducing harms of overscreening. This is a crucial question, as women over age 65 years who are living with human immunodeficiency virus comprise a rapidly growing population.
31654338|Explaining Chronic Illness and Self-Rated Health Among Immigrants of Five Hispanic Ethnicities.|Lo, Celia C; Adame, Jessica L; Cheng, Tyrone C; |2019 10 25|The largest racial/ethnic minority group in the United States, Hispanics, especially Hispanic immigrants, have been considered healthier than groups of other ethnicity (including Whites, the majority). However, chronic illnesses such as cancer and diabetes are often seen in this culturally, ethnically diverse group. The present study had two aims. First was to explain two health outcomes, which were presence of chronic illness (any of the five common conditions cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension, cancer, and/or diabetes/prediabetes) and self-rated health, in terms of links to certain factors in acculturation, social status, health, social support, and lifestyle. Second was to determine how uniform these links might be across five ethnic groups: Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Central/South American. We combined data from 17 years of the National Health Interview Survey (1999-2015) and subjected these secondary measures to logistic and linear regression, separately by ethnicity, to explain both outcomes. With few exceptions, results generally linked illness/health to the tested independent variables. Additionally, results confirmed ethnicity to moderate the outcomes' associations with the independent variables. Ethnicity-specific analysis showed the two outcomes to exhibit dissimilar relationships with certain independent variables across ethnic groups. Research that (as has been common) lumps together respondents whose Hispanic ethnicities may differ disregards some meaningful variation rather than accounting for it. In future research-and in subsequent evidence-based policy/practice development-all essential sociocultural factors, including ethnicity, should be carefully outlined, advancing good health for the entire Hispanic immigrant population.

31605037|The future of clinical trials in urological oncology.|Narayan, Vikram M; Dahm, Philipp; |2019 10 11|Well-designed clinical trials in urological oncology help to guide treatment decisions and aid in counselling patients, ultimately serving to improve outcomes. Since the term evidence-based medicine was first used by Gordon Guyatt in 1991, a renewed emphasis on methodology, transparent trial design and study reporting has helped to improve clinical research and in turn, the landscape of medical literature. Novel clinical trial designs (including multi-arm, multistage trials, basket and umbrella studies and research from big data sources, such as electronic health records, administrative claims databases and quality monitoring registries) are well suited to advance innovation in urological oncology. Existing urological clinical trials are often limited by small numbers, are statistically underpowered and many face difficulties with accrual. Thus, efforts to improve trial design are of considerable importance. The development and use of standard outcome sets and adherence to reporting guidelines offer researchers the opportunity to guide value-oriented care, minimize research waste and efficiently identify solutions to the unanswered questions in urology cancer care.

Surgery is considered the gold standard treatment. Techniques include curettage and electrodesiccation, surgical excision, and Mohs micrographic surgery. While each is effective, there are relative advantages and disadvantages with respect to cost, time, quality of life, and role in patients with limited life expectancy. Preventing local tumor recurrence is the primary objective; however, recurrence rates are based on retrospective data, and high-quality comparator studies assessing effectiveness are scarce. Prospective and randomized controlled trials are imperative to create comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations for the surgical management of NMSC.

The standard of care treatment for most early rectal cancers is radical surgery alone. Given the morbidity associated with radical surgery, local excision for early rectal cancers has been explored as an alternative approach associated with lower rates of morbidity. The American Radium Society Appropriate Use Criteria presented in this manuscript are evidence-based guidelines for the use of local excision in early stage rectal cancer that include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) used by a multidisciplinary expert panel to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures. In those instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment. These guidelines are intended for the use of all practitioners and patients who desire information regarding the use of local excision in rectal cancer.

We conducted a meta-analysis to assess this evidence. We included observational studies investigating the association between any definition of hypertension or systolic and diastolic blood pressure and risk of any cancer, after searching PubMed until November 2017. We calculated summary relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using inverse-variance weighted random effects methods. A total of 148 eligible publications were identified out of 39,891 initially screened citations. Considering only evidence from 85 prospective studies, positive associations were observed between hypertension and kidney, colorectal and breast cancer. Positive associations between hypertension and risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, liver and endometrial cancer were also observed, but the majority of studies did not perform comprehensive multivariable adjustments. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure were positively associated with risk of kidney cancer but not with other cancers. In addition to the previously well-described association between hypertension and risk of kidney cancer, the current meta-analysis suggested that hypertensive individuals may also be at higher risk of colorectal and breast cancer. However, careful interpretation is required as most meta-analyses included relatively small number of studies, several relative risks had weak or moderate magnitude and maybe affected by residual confounding.

In response, over the past 7 years, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has recognized the important role that cancer centers play in their community and has gradually increased the requirements and stringency of these sections in the Cancer Center Support Grant guidelines to include a plan for community outreach and engagement. Developing sustainable community-academic partnerships is an essential factor for the successful dissemination and implementation of promising interventions and programs aimed at decreasing barriers and improving cancer outcomes. Understanding how best to facilitate linkages and collaboration can expedite translation of research knowledge into practice and allow more evidence-based improvements to be implemented into practice as well as influence research agendas. This article will examine several examples of successful community-academic partnerships focused on cancer prevention and control and explore lessons learned.
31099672|Using Big Data and Predictive Analytics to Determine Patient Risk in Oncology.|Parikh, Ravi B; Gdowski, Andrew; Patt, Debra A; Hertler, Andrew; Mermel, Craig; Bekelman, Justin E; |2019 05 17|Big data and predictive analytics have immense potential to improve risk stratification, particularly in data-rich fields like oncology. This article reviews the literature published on use cases and challenges in applying predictive analytics to improve risk stratification in oncology. We characterized evidence-based use cases of predictive analytics in oncology into three distinct fields: (1) population health management, (2) radiomics, and (3) pathology. We then highlight promising future use cases of predictive analytics in clinical decision support and genomic risk stratification. We conclude by describing challenges in the future applications of big data in oncology, namely (1) difficulties in acquisition of comprehensive data and endpoints, (2) the lack of prospective validation of predictive tools, and (3) the risk of automating bias in observational datasets. If such challenges can be overcome, computational techniques for clinical risk stratification will in short order improve clinical risk stratification for patients with cancer.
31045449|Dissemination of Information on Neutropenic Diet by Top US Cancer Centers: In-line with the Evidence?|Brown, Timothy J; Mukhija, Dhruvika; Premnath, Naveen; Venkatraman, Anand; Jiv Singh Nagpal, Sajan; Gupta, Arjun; |2019 05 02|Aim: The neutropenic diet is commonly prescribed to cancer patients with neutropenia with the goal of reducing infections. However, multiple randomized trials have proved no benefit with neutropenic diets compared to less restricted diets with regards to reducing infectious risk. We aimed to ascertain if top cancer centers recommended for or against the use of neutropenic diets on their official websites. Methods: We reviewed the websites of the top 20 hospitals in the 2017 US News Best Hospitals for Cancer©, and ascertained recommendations for neutropenic diet (for, against, equivocal, or not addressed). Results: Seven websites (35%) made recommendations for, four (20%) against, and nine (45%) did not address the neutropenic diet. Only five (25%) backed any of their recommendations with evidence (four against, one for), including two (10%) links to abstracts (both against), whereas seven mentioned the FDA safe food handling guidelines (non-exclusive). Type of recommendation made (for or against) did not depend on US News rank (top vs bottom 10; p = 1.00.). Conclusion: The neutropenic diet continues to be recommended on many (35%) websites of top US cancer centers, despite strong evidence against its use. The website content of major US cancer centers should be updated to better guide patients regarding neutropenic diets.

Its goal is to generate an informed and current understanding of the impact of genetic variation on cancer risk across the iconic cancer predisposition genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2. Initially, reported variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 available from public databases were integrated into a single, newly created site, www.brcaexchange.org. The purpose of the BRCA Exchange is to provide the community with a reliable and easily accessible record of variants interpreted for a high-penetrance phenotype. More than 20,000 variants have been aggregated, three times the number found in the next-largest public database at the project's outset, of which approximately 7,250 have expert classifications. The data set is based on shared information from existing clinical databases-Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC), ClinVar, and the Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD)-as well as population databases, all linked to a single point of access. The BRCA Challenge has brought together the existing international Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles (ENIGMA) consortium expert panel, along with expert clinicians, diagnosticians, researchers, and database providers, all with a common goal of advancing our understanding of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variation. Ongoing work includes direct contact with national centers with access to BRCA1 and BRCA2 diagnostic data to encourage data sharing, development of methods suitable for extraction of genetic variation at the level of individual laboratory reports, and engagement with participant communities to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the clinical significance of genetic variation in BRCA1 and BRCA2.

If used universally, synoptic reporting enhances comparing data globally for scientific leverage. The International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to develop evidence-based, universally available surgical pathology reporting data sets. Multiple different sites within the head and neck may be affected by mucosal melanoma, whose behavior and patient outcome are not equivalent to carcinomas of the corresponding sites. Factors such as Breslow thickness and Clark depth of invasion applied to cutaneous melanomas do not yield any prognostic significance in mucosal sites, and thus are not meaningful. Likewise, margin assessment is unique in head and neck sites. Further, the genetic profile of mucosal melanomas is different from that of most cutaneous tumors. Thus, within the head and neck region, mucosal melanoma is a distinct entity for which a dedicated data set was developed for implementation. The elements that comprise the core (required) and noncore (recommended) elements are discussed.

The International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to develop evidence-based, universally available surgical pathology reporting data sets. Within the head and neck region, lymph node excisions and neck dissections are frequently performed as part of the management of head and neck cancers arising from the mucosal sites (sinonasal tract, nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, oral cavity, and larynx) along with bone tumors, skin cancers, melanomas, and other tumor categories. The type of specimen, exact location (lymph node level), laterality, and orientation (by suture or diagram) are essential to accurate classification. There are significant staging differences for each anatomic site within the head and neck when lymph node sampling is considered, most importantly related to human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal carcinomas and mucosal melanomas. Number, size, and site of affected lymph nodes, including guidelines on determining the size of tumor deposits and the presence of extranodal extension and soft tissue metastasis, are presented in the context of prognostication. This review elaborates on each of the elements included in the data set for Nodal Excisions and Neck Dissection Specimens for Head & Neck Tumours.

Odontogenic tumors are rare, which limits evidence-based support for designing a scientifically sound data set for reporting them. Thus, the selection of reportable elements within the data set and considering them as either core or noncore is principally based on evidence from malignancies affecting other organ systems, limited case series, expert opinions, and/or anecdotal reports. Nevertheless, this data set serves as the initial step toward standardized reporting on malignant odontogenic tumors that should evolve over time as more evidence becomes available and functions as a prompt for further research to provide such evidence.

Cancer rehabilitation clinicians, researchers, and policy makers could learn from the multidisciplinary specialty of palliative care, which has benefited from a growth strategy and has garnered national recognition as an important and necessary aspect of oncology care. The purpose of this article is to explore the actions that have increased the uptake and integration of palliative care to yield insights and multimodal strategies for the development and growth of cancer rehabilitation. After examining the history of palliative care and its growth, the authors highlight 5 key strategies that may benefit the field of cancer rehabilitation: 1) stimulating the science in specific gap areas; 2) creating clinical practice guidelines; 3) building clinical capacity; 4) ascertaining and responding to public opinion; and 5) advocating for public policy change. Coordinated and simultaneous advances on these 5 strategies may catalyze the growth, utilization, and effectiveness of patient screening, timely referrals, and delivery of appropriate cancer rehabilitation care that reduces disability and improves quality of life for cancer survivors who need these services.

The goal of this paper is to present the background, design and pilot of Project TEACH (Tobacco Education and Cessation in the Health System) developed to improve clinical practice by offering specialized training in the provision of smoking cessation interventions to care providers in community mental health centers in Texas. This is achieved through engaging the expertise of clinicians at the MD Anderson Cancer Center's Tobacco Treatment Program and disseminating this expertise to care providers by means of a novel tele-mentoring approach called Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes). Evaluation of our pilot ECHO training project demonstrated that the training was very well received and resulted in self-reported enhancement of the providers' professional practice. This is the first project to extend the collaborative ECHO model to train healthcare providers in smoking cessation. This approach has potential to reduce smoking rates among smokers with mental and behavioral health needs, and consequently contribute to the prevention of cancer and other chronic diseases in this vulnerable population.

30277572|Improving patient and caregiver outcomes in oncology: Team-based, timely, and targeted palliative care.|Hui, David; Hannon, Breffni L; Zimmermann, Camilla; Bruera, Eduardo; |2018 09 13|Over the past decade, a large body of evidence has accumulated supporting the integration of palliative care into oncology practice for patients with advanced cancer. The question is no longer whether palliative care should be offered, but what is the optimal model of delivery, when is the ideal time to refer, who is in greatest need of a referral, and how much palliative care should oncologists themselves be providing. These questions are particularly relevant given the scarcity of palliative care resources internationally. In this state-of-the-science review directed at the practicing cancer clinician, the authors first discuss the contemporary literature examining the impact of specialist palliative care on various health outcomes. Then, conceptual models are provided to support team-based, timely, and targeted palliative care. Team-based palliative care allows the interdisciplinary members to address comprehensively the multidimensional care needs of patients and their caregivers. Timely palliative care, at its best, is preventive care to minimize crises at the end of life. Targeted palliative care involves identifying the patients most likely to benefit from specialist palliative care interventions, akin to the concept of targeted cancer therapies. Finally, the strengths and weaknesses of innovative care models, such as outpatient clinics, embedded clinics, nurse-led palliative care, primary palliative care provided by oncology teams, and automatic referral, are summarized. Moving forward, more research is needed to determine how different health systems can best personalize palliative care to provide the right level of intervention, for the right patient, in the right setting, at the right time.

We used Intervention Mapping (IM) to develop and adapt a theory- and evidence-based educational intervention targeting parents of Hispanic adolescents to increase HPV vaccination. Methods: We followed IM steps 1-6 to: (1) develop a logic model and identify modifiable factors associated with vaccination among Hispanic adolescents by conducting literature reviews, focus groups, and in-depth interviews with Hispanic parents; (2) develop outcomes, write performance objectives, and develop a matrix of change objectives; (3) develop and identify a program theme, program components, theoretical methods, and practical applications; (4) develop an intervention design plan; (5) develop implementation strategies; and (6) develop an evaluation plan. We completed Steps 1-6 for to develop an intervention targeting parents of females, and we followed the steps again to adapt the program once HPV vaccine recommendations included males. Results: The program Por Nuestras Hijas (For Our Daughters) included two components: a print fotonovela and a tailored interactive multimedia intervention (TIMI). The program utilized the methods tailoring, targeting, framing, anticipated regret, modeling, skill building, and education and counseling to target the following determinants: parental knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, skills, perceived benefits/barriers, perceived susceptibility, perceived norms, and outcome expectations as modifiable factors influencing HPV vaccination. Lay health workers implemented the program in community clinics. A logic model of change guided evaluation planning. We later adapted the outcome and intervention content for parents of Hispanic adolescent males and changed the theme to Por Nuestros Hijos (For Our Children). Throughout the development and adaptation processes, we relied on theory, empirical evidence, and new data to make decisions. Discussion: IM provided a systematic methodology for program development and adaptation. Tasks in each step built upon one another integrating findings from the literature, previous research, qualitative findings, and theory to develop two educational programs for parents to increase HPV vaccination. The systematic process allowed us to develop messages and materials targeting factors beyond HPV knowledge or awareness to create behavior change.

However, the role of FCM in assessment of subsequent specimens is unclear. We developed an algorithm to reduce the number of low-yield FCM tests without significant impact on clinically meaningful results. Patients with hematologic malignancies were studied in a derivation cohort, and the following algorithm was developed: (1) cytology and FCM on all initial samples, (2) cytology on all subsequent samples, and (3) FCM on subsequent samples only if previous FCM was positive. A separate population served as the validation cohort. The derivation cohort included 197 patients representing 1157 cytology and 543 FCM samples. Common malignancies were B-Cell ALL (25.3%), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (29.4%), and Burkitt lymphoma (7.7%). In the derivation cohort, the algorithm yielded a sensitivity of 90.0% (95% CI, 81.2-95.6%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 98.9-100.0%). The validation cohort included 132 patients with 563 cytology and 602 FCM samples. In the validation cohort, the testing algorithm yielded a sensitivity of 87.5% (95% CI, 75.9-94.8%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 99.1-100.0%). Of the 15 samples that were missed by the algorithm, FCM findings did not impact patients' management because of known CNS disease (seven patients) or they were responding to treatment (eight patients). CSF testing in hematologic malignancies using the proposed algorithm presents an evidence-based approach to reduce the number of unnecessary FCM tests of CSF without compromising patient care.

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) analysis has recently unveiled 4 genotypes of gastric cancer with data not ready to change treatment strategy yet. A multimodality approach to therapy is the cornerstone of screening, diagnosing, staging, treating and supporting patients with gastric cancer. The evidence-based approach to localized gastric cancer (>cT1b) is to use an either preoperative or postoperative strategy to maximize the benefit of surgery. The focus of future research is to optimize chemotherapy regimens, determine the role of radiation therapy and investigate the effect of treatment timing. In metastatic gastric cancer, biologic therapies have been introduced targeting markers shown to be prognostic. The results of ongoing randomized controlled phase 3 trials using targeted and immunotherapy agents, either in combination or alone, have the potential to alter the current treatment landscape of advanced gastric cancer.

Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 18 HbA1c-associated genetic variants. These variants proved to be classifiable by their likely biological action as erythrocytic (also associated with erythrocyte traits) or glycemic (associated with other glucose-related traits). In this study, we tested the hypotheses that, in a very large scale GWAS, we would identify more genetic variants associated with HbA1c and that HbA1c variants implicated in erythrocytic biology would affect the diagnostic accuracy of HbA1c. We therefore expanded the number of HbA1c-associated loci and tested the effect of genetic risk-scores comprised of erythrocytic or glycemic variants on incident diabetes prediction and on prevalent diabetes screening performance. Throughout this multiancestry study, we kept a focus on interancestry differences in HbA1c genetics performance that might influence race-ancestry differences in health outcomes.

Sexual risk-taking behaviors, including early sexual initiation, contribute to these public health problems. Over 35 sexual health evidence-based programs (EBPs) have been shown to reduce sexual risk behaviors and/or prevent teen pregnancies or STIs. Because more than half of these EBPs are designed for schools, they could reach and impact a considerable number of adolescents if implemented in these settings. Most schools across the U.S. and in Texas, however, do not implement these programs. U.S. school districts face many barriers to the successful dissemination (i.e., adoption, implementation, and maintenance) of sexual health EBPs, including lack of knowledge about EBPs and where to find them, perceived lack of support from school administrators and parents, lack of guidance regarding the adoption process, competing priorities, and lack of specialized training on sexual health. Therefore, this paper describes how we used intervention mapping (Steps 3 and 4, in particular), a systematic design framework that uses theory, empirical evidence, and input from the community to develop CHoosing And Maintaining Effective Programs for Sex Education in Schools (iCHAMPSS), an online decision support system to help school districts adopt, implement, and maintain sexual health EBPs. Guided by this systematic intervention design approach, iCHAMPSS has the potential to increase dissemination of sexual health EBPs in school settings.

Methods The ASCO NSCLC Expert Panel made recommendations based on a systematic review of randomized controlled trials from February 2014 to December 2016 plus the Cancer Care Ontario Program in Evidence-Based Care's update of a previous ASCO search. Results This guideline update reflects changes in evidence since the previous guideline update. Fourteen randomized controlled trials provide the evidence base; earlier phase trials also informed recommendation development. Recommendations New or revised recommendations include the following. Regarding first-line treatment for patients with non-squamous cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma (without positive markers, eg, EGFR/ALK /ROS1), if the patient has high programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, pembrolizumab should be used alone; if the patient has low PD-L1 expression, clinicians should offer standard chemotherapy. All other clinical scenarios follow 2015 recommendations. Regarding second-line treatment in patients who received first-line chemotherapy, without prior immune checkpoint therapy, if NSCLC tumor is positive for PD-L1 expression, clinicians should use single-agent nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or atezolizumab; if tumor has negative or unknown PD-L1 expression, clinicians should use nivolumab or atezolizumab. All immune checkpoint therapy is recommended alone plus in the absence of contraindications. For patients who received a prior first-line immune checkpoint inhibitor, clinicians should offer standard chemotherapy. For patients who cannot receive immune checkpoint inhibitor after chemotherapy, docetaxel is recommended; in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC, pemetrexed is recommended. In patients with a sensitizing EGFR mutation, disease progression after first-line epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, and T790M mutation, osimertinib is recommended; if NSCLC lacks the T790M mutation, then chemotherapy is recommended. Patients with ROS1 gene rearrangement without prior crizotinib may be offered crizotinib, or if they previously received crizotinib, they may be offered chemotherapy.

Following a review of current DCIS management protocols a more conservative approach has been suggested. Clinical trials have been introduced to evaluate the option of avoiding surgical intervention in a proportion of patients with DCIS defined as ""low-risk"" using certain clinicopathological criteria. These trials can potentially provide evidence-based models of active surveillance (with or without endocrine therapy) as a future management approach. Despite the undisputable fact of our need to address the obvious overtreatment of screen-detected DCIS, some important questions need to be considered regarding these trials including the eligibility criteria and definition of risk, the proportion of patient eligible for inclusion, and the length of time required for proper analysis of the trials' outcome in view of the long-term natural history of DCIS progression particularly the low-risk group. These factors can potentially affect the practicality and future impact of such trials. This review provides critical analysis of current DCIS management trials and highlights critical issues related to their practicality and the expected outcome."

Yet cancer-related nutritional risk is sometimes overlooked or under-treated by clinicians, patients, and their families. The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) recently published evidence-based guidelines for nutritional care in patients with cancer. In further support of these guidelines, an ESPEN oncology expert group met for a Cancer and Nutrition Workshop in Berlin on October 24 and 25, 2016. The group examined the causes and consequences of cancer-related malnutrition, reviewed treatment approaches currently available, and built the rationale and impetus for clinicians involved with care of patients with cancer to take actions that facilitate nutrition support in practice. The content of this position paper is based on presentations and discussions at the Berlin meeting. The expert group emphasized 3 key steps to update nutritional care for people with cancer: (1) screen all patients with cancer for nutritional risk early in the course of their care, regardless of body mass index and weight history; (2) expand nutrition-related assessment practices to include measures of anorexia, body composition, inflammatory biomarkers, resting energy expenditure, and physical function; (3) use multimodal nutritional interventions with individualized plans, including care focused on increasing nutritional intake, lessening inflammation and hypermetabolic stress, and increasing physical activity.

Although of benign origin, osteoblastomas tend to behave more aggressively clinically than other benign tumors. Because of the low incidence of osteoblastomas, evidence-based treatment guidelines and high-quality research are lacking, which has resulted in inconsistent treatment. The goal of this study was to determine whether application of the Enneking classification in the management of spinal osteoblastomas influences local recurrence and survival time. METHODS A multicenter database of patients who underwent surgical intervention for spinal osteoblastoma was developed by the AOSpine Knowledge Forum Tumor. Patient data pertaining to demographics, diagnosis, treatment, cross-sectional survival, and local recurrence were collected. Patients in 2 cohorts, based on the Enneking classification of the tumor (Enneking appropriate [EA] and Enneking inappropriate [EI]), were analyzed. If the final pathology margin matched the Enneking-recommended surgical margin, the tumor was classified as EA; if not, it was classified as EI. RESULTS A total of 102 patients diagnosed with a spinal osteoblastoma were identified between November 1991 and June 2012. Twenty-nine patients were omitted from the analysis because of short follow-up time, incomplete survival data, or invalid staging, which left 73 patients for the final analysis. Thirteen (18%) patients suffered a local recurrence, and 6 (8%) patients died during the study period. Local recurrence was strongly associated with mortality (relative risk 9.2; p = 0.008). When adjusted for Enneking appropriateness, this result was not altered significantly. No significant differences were found between the EA and EI groups in regard to local recurrence and mortality. CONCLUSIONS In this evaluation of the largest multicenter cohort of spinal osteoblastomas, local recurrence was found to be strongly associated with mortality. Application of the Enneking classification as a treatment guide for preventing local recurrence was not validated.

|2016 09 12|To dissect the genetic architecture of blood pressure and assess effects on target organ damage, we analyzed 128,272 SNPs from targeted and genome-wide arrays in 201,529 individuals of European ancestry, and genotypes from an additional 140,886 individuals were used for validation. We identified 66 blood pressure-associated loci, of which 17 were new; 15 harbored multiple distinct association signals. The 66 index SNPs were enriched for cis-regulatory elements, particularly in vascular endothelial cells, consistent with a primary role in blood pressure control through modulation of vascular tone across multiple tissues. The 66 index SNPs combined in a risk score showed comparable effects in 64,421 individuals of non-European descent. The 66-SNP blood pressure risk score was significantly associated with target organ damage in multiple tissues but with minor effects in the kidney. Our findings expand current knowledge of blood pressure-related pathways and highlight tissues beyond the classical renal system in blood pressure regulation.

27413657|An evidence-based conceptual framework of healthy cooking.|Raber, Margaret; Chandra, Joya; Upadhyaya, Mudita; Schick, Vanessa; Strong, Larkin L; Durand, Casey; Sharma, Shreela; |2016 05 17|Eating out of the home has been positively associated with body weight, obesity, and poor diet quality. While cooking at home has declined steadily over the last several decades, the benefits of home cooking have gained attention in recent years and many healthy cooking projects have emerged around the United States. The purpose of this study was to develop an evidence-based conceptual framework of healthy cooking behavior in relation to chronic disease prevention. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken using broad search terms. Studies analyzing the impact of cooking behaviors across a range of disciplines were included. Experts in the field reviewed the resulting constructs in a small focus group. The model was developed from the extant literature on the subject with 59 studies informing 5 individual constructs (frequency, techniques and methods, minimal usage, flavoring, and ingredient additions/replacements), further defined by a series of individual behaviors. Face validity of these constructs was supported by the focus group. A validated conceptual model is a significant step toward better understanding the relationship between cooking, disease and disease prevention and may serve as a base for future assessment tools and curricula.

27380817|Programmable Bio-nanochip Platform: A Point-of-Care Biosensor System with the Capacity To Learn.|McRae, Michael P; Simmons, Glennon; Wong, Jorge; McDevitt, John T; |2016 07 06|"The combination of point-of-care (POC) medical microdevices and machine learning has the potential transform the practice of medicine. In this area, scalable lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices have many advantages over standard laboratory methods, including faster analysis, reduced cost, lower power consumption, and higher levels of integration and automation. Despite significant advances in LOC technologies over the years, several remaining obstacles are preventing clinical implementation and market penetration of these novel medical microdevices. Similarly, while machine learning has seen explosive growth in recent years and promises to shift the practice of medicine toward data-intensive and evidence-based decision making, its uptake has been hindered due to the lack of integration between clinical measurements and disease determinations. In this Account, we describe recent developments in the programmable bio-nanochip (p-BNC) system, a biosensor platform with the capacity for learning. The p-BNC is a ""platform to digitize biology"" in which small quantities of patient sample generate immunofluorescent signal on agarose bead sensors that is optically extracted and converted to antigen concentrations. The platform comprises disposable microfluidic cartridges, a portable analyzer, automated data analysis software, and intuitive mobile health interfaces. The single-use cartridges are fully integrated, self-contained microfluidic devices containing aqueous buffers conveniently embedded for POC use. A novel fluid delivery method was developed to provide accurate and repeatable flow rates via actuation of the cartridge's blister packs. A portable analyzer instrument was designed to integrate fluid delivery, optical detection, image analysis, and user interface, representing a universal system for acquiring, processing, and managing clinical data while overcoming many of the challenges facing the widespread clinical adoption of LOC technologies. We demonstrate the p-BNC's flexibility through the completion of multiplex assays within the single-use disposable cartridges for three clinical applications: prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and acute myocardial infarction. Toward the goal of creating ""sensors that learn"", we have developed and describe here the Cardiac ScoreCard, a clinical decision support system for a spectrum of cardiovascular disease. The Cardiac ScoreCard approach comprises a comprehensive biomarker panel and risk factor information in a predictive model capable of assessing early risk and late-stage disease progression for heart attack and heart failure patients. These marker-driven tests have the potential to radically reduce costs, decrease wait times, and introduce new options for patients needing regular health monitoring. Further, these efforts demonstrate the clinical utility of fusing data from information-rich biomarkers and the Internet of Things (IoT) using predictive analytics to generate single-index assessments for wellness/illness status. By promoting disease prevention and personalized wellness management, tools of this nature have the potential to improve health care exponentially."

AHRQ funded eight grantees (seven regional Cooperatives and one independent national evaluation) to participate in EvidenceNOW. The national evaluation examines quality improvement efforts and outcomes for more than 1500 small primary care practices (restricted to those with fewer than ten physicians per clinic). Examples of external support include practice facilitation, expert consultation, performance feedback, and educational materials and activities. This paper describes the study protocol for the EvidenceNOW national evaluation, which is called Evaluating System Change to Advance Learning and Take Evidence to Scale (ESCALATES).

This study investigated barriers and facilitators to healthy eating and physical activity (PA) in overweight Mexican-origin smokers to inform the adaptation of an evidence-based smoking cessation program into a multiple health behavior change intervention. Five focus groups were conducted with overweight Mexican-origin men (n = 9) and women (n = 21) who smoked. Barriers and facilitators of healthy eating and PA were identified, and gender differences were assessed. Participants expressed some motivation to eat healthfully and identified strategies for doing so, yet many women experienced difficulties related to personal, family and work-related circumstances. Barriers to healthy eating among men were related to food preferences and lack of familiarity with fruits and vegetables. Participants performed PA primarily within the context of work and domestic responsibilities. Stress/depressed mood, lack of motivation and concern for physical well-being limited further PA engagement. Routines involving eating, PA and smoking highlight how these behaviors may be intertwined. Findings emphasize the importance of social, structural and cultural contexts and call for additional investigation into how to integrate healthy eating and PA into smoking cessation interventions for overweight Mexican-origin smokers.

However, the evidence base regarding how best to care for these patients remains limited due to their underrepresentation in cancer clinical trials. Pragmatic clinical trials represent a promising approach for enhancing the evidence base in geriatric oncology by allowing investigators to enroll older, frailer patients onto cancer clinical trials. These trials are more accessible, less resource intensive, and place minimal additional burden on participating patients. Additionally, these trials can be designed to measure endpoints directly relevant to older adults, such as quality of life, functional independence and treatment tolerability which are often not addressed in standard clinical trials. Therefore, pragmatic clinical trials allow researchers to include patients for whom the treatment will ultimately be applied and to utilize meaningful endpoints. Examples of pragmatic studies include both large, simple trials and cluster randomized trials. These study designs allow investigators to conduct clinical trials within the context of everyday practice. Further, researchers can devise these studies to place minimal burden on the patient, the treating clinicians and the participating institutions. In order to be successful, pragmatic trials must efficiently utilize the electronic medical record for data capture while also maximizing patient recruitment, enrollment and retention. Additionally, by strategically utilizing pragmatic clinical trials to test therapies and interventions that have previously shown efficacy in younger, fitter patients, these trials represent a potential mechanism to improve the evidence base in geriatric oncology and enhance care for older adults with cancer.

The Clinical Sequencing Exploratory Research (CSER) consortium includes 18 extramural research projects, one National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) intramural project, and a coordinating center funded by the NHGRI and National Cancer Institute. The consortium is exploring analytic and clinical validity and utility, as well as the ethical, legal, and social implications of sequencing via multidisciplinary approaches; it has thus far recruited 5,577 participants across a spectrum of symptomatic and healthy children and adults by utilizing both germline and cancer sequencing. The CSER consortium is analyzing data and creating publically available procedures and tools related to participant preferences and consent, variant classification, disclosure and management of primary and secondary findings, health outcomes, and integration with electronic health records. Future research directions will refine measures of clinical utility of CGES in both germline and somatic testing, evaluate the use of CGES for screening in healthy individuals, explore the penetrance of pathogenic variants through extensive phenotyping, reduce discordances in public databases of genes and variants, examine social and ethnic disparities in the provision of genomics services, explore regulatory issues, and estimate the value and downstream costs of sequencing. The CSER consortium has established a shared community of research sites by using diverse approaches to pursue the evidence-based development of best practices in genomic medicine.

While there are established guidelines for early detection of breast cancer in high-risk women who have not undergone RRM, there are less developed guidelines after RRM. We evaluated the schemes offered before and after RRS in internationally diverse high-risk clinics. An e-mailed survey was distributed to high-risk clinics affiliated with CIMBA. Overall, 22 centers from 16 countries responded. Pre RRS surveillance schemes overwhelmingly included breast imaging (primarily MRI) from 18 to 30 years and clinical breast exam (CBE) at 6-12 month intervals. For ovarian cancer, all but 6 centers offered semiannual/annual gynecological exam, transvaginal ultrasound, and CA 125 measurements. Post RRM, most centers offered only annual CBE while 4 centers offered annual MRI, primarily for substantial residual breast tissue. After RRSO only 4 centers offered specific gynecological surveillance. Existing guidelines for breast/ovarian cancer detection in BRCA carriers are being applied pre RRS but are not globally harmonized, and most centers offer no specific surveillance post RRS. From this comprehensive multinational study it is clear that evidence-based, long-term prospective data on the most effective scheme for BRCA carriers post RRS is needed.

However, addressing tobacco in patients being treated for comorbid conditions is not a consistent practice. Recognizing the need for a ""call-to-action"" to address tobacco use in people with comorbid conditions, the Tobacco Treatment Network within the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) convened a Comorbidities Workgroup to explore the relationship between smoking and comorbid disease to identify common themes including: the harms associated with continued tobacco use, the frequency of comorbid disease and tobacco use, the potential effect of comorbid disease on the ability to quit tobacco use, the association between tobacco use and suboptimal disease-specific treatment response, and evidence regarding potential approaches to improve addressing tobacco use in patients with comorbid disease. Five candidate conditions (psychiatric, cancer, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and human immunodeficiency virus infected patients) were explored. Across comorbid conditions, smoking adversely affects treatment efficacy and promotes other adverse health conditions. People with comorbid conditions who smoke are motivated to quit and respond to evidence-based smoking cessation treatments. However, tobacco cessation is not regularly incorporated into the clinical care of many individuals with comorbidities. Optimal strategies for addressing tobacco use within each comorbid disease are also not well defined. Further work is needed to disseminate evidence-based care into clinical practice for smokers with comorbid disease and addiction research should consider comorbid conditions as an important construct to explore."

To date, the majority of the published literature and research on competency assessment comes from the subspecialty of point-of-care ultrasound. A group of radiologists, physicists, and emergency physicians convened at the 2015 Academic Emergency Medicine consensus conference to discuss and prioritize a research agenda related to education, assessment, and competency in ordering and interpreting diagnostic imaging. A set of questions for the continued development of an educational curriculum on diagnostic imaging for trainees and competency assessment using specific assessment methods based on current best practices was delineated. The research priorities were developed through an iterative consensus-driven process using a modified nominal group technique that culminated in an in-person breakout session. The four recommendations are: 1) develop a diagnostic imaging curriculum for emergency medicine (EM) residency training; 2) develop, study, and validate tools to assess competency in diagnostic imaging interpretation; 3) evaluate the role of simulation in education, assessment, and competency measures for diagnostic imaging; 4) study is needed regarding the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria, an evidence-based peer-reviewed resource in determining the use of diagnostic imaging, to maximize its value in EM. In this article, the authors review the supporting reliability and validity evidence and make specific recommendations for future research on the education, competency, and assessment of learning diagnostic imaging.
26504790|Evaluation of the Effectiveness and Implementation of an Adapted Evidence-Based Mammography Intervention for African American Women.|Highfield, Linda; Hartman, Marieke A; Bartholomew, L Kay; Balihe, Philomene; Ausborn, Valerie A; |2015 10 04|Breast cancer mortality disparities continue, particularly for uninsured and minority women. A number of effective evidence-based interventions (EBIs) exist for addressing barriers to mammography screening; however, their uptake and use in community has been limited. Few cancer-specific studies have evaluated adapted EBIs in new contexts, and fewer still have considered implementation. This study sought to (1) evaluate the effectiveness of an adapted mammography EBI in improving appointment keeping in African American women and (2) describe processes of implementation in a new practice setting. We used the type 1 hybrid design to test effectiveness and implementation using a quasi-experimental design. Logistic regression and intent-to-treat analysis were used to evaluate mammography appointment attendance. The no-show rate was 44% (comparison) versus 19% (intervention). The adjusted odds of a woman in the intervention group attending her appointment were 3.88 (p < 0.001). The adjusted odds of a woman attending her appointment in the intent-to-treat analysis were 2.31 (p < 0.05). Adapted EBI effectiveness was 3.88 (adjusted OR) versus 2.10 (OR) for the original program, indicating enhanced program effect. A number of implementation barriers and facilitators were identified. Our findings support previous studies noting that sequentially measuring EBI efficacy and effectiveness, followed by implementation, may be missing important contextual information.
26500341|Improving evidence on anticoagulant therapies for venous thromboembolism in children: key challenges and opportunities.|Goldenberg, Neil A; Takemoto, Clifford M; Yee, Donald L; Kittelson, John M; Massicotte, M Patricia; |2015 10 23|Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is increasingly diagnosed in pediatric patients, and anticoagulant use in this population has become common, despite the absence of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for this indication. Guidelines for the use of anticoagulants in pediatrics are largely extrapolated from large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults, smaller dose-finding and observational studies in children, and expert opinion. The recently FDA-approved direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, provide potential advantages over oral vitamin K antagonists and subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs). However, key questions arise regarding their potential off-label clinical application in pediatric thromboembolic disease. In this Perspective, we provide background on the use of LMWHs such as enoxaparin as the mainstay of treatment of pediatric provoked VTE; identify key questions and challenges with regard to DOAC trials and future DOAC therapy in pediatric VTE; and discuss applicable lessons learned from the recent pilot/feasibility phase of a large multicenter RCT of anticoagulant duration in pediatric VTE. The challenges and lessons learned present opportunities to improve evidence for anticoagulant therapies in pediatric VTE through future clinical trials.

26149521|Minimally invasive colorectal surgery: status and technical specifications.|Keller, D S; Ibarra, S; Haas, E M; |2015 07 07|Laparoscopy was the most significant technologic advance in colorectal surgery in the last quarter century. The safety, feasibility and oncologic equivalence have been proven, and undisputed clinical benefits have also been demonstrated over open approaches. Despite proven benefits, laparoscopic has not dominated the market, especially for colon and rectal cancer cases. Adaptations in laparoscopic technique were developed to increase use of minimally invasive surgery. Concurrently, there has been a paradigm shift toward less invasive technologies to further optimize patient outcomes. From these needs, hand assisted laparoscopic surgery (HALS), single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS), and robotic assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALS) were applied to colorectal surgery. Each platform has unique costs and benefits, and similar outcomes when likened to each other in comparative studies. However, conventional laparoscopy, HALS, SILS, and RALS actually serve a complementary role as tools to increase the use of minimally invasive colorectal surgery. The goal of this paper is to review the history, current status, technical specifications, and evolution of the major minimally invasive platforms for colorectal surgery.

The workshop questions and key outcomes were as follows. (1) Do genotoxicity and mutagenicity assays in somatic cells predict germ cell effects? Limited data suggest that somatic cell tests detect most germ cell mutagens, but there are strong concerns that dictate caution in drawing conclusions. (2) Should germ cell tests be done, and when? If there is evidence that a chemical or its metabolite(s) will not reach target germ cells or gonadal tissue, it is not necessary to conduct germ cell tests, notwithstanding somatic outcomes. However, it was recommended that negative somatic cell mutagens with clear evidence for gonadal exposure and evidence of toxicity in germ cells could be considered for germ cell mutagenicity testing. For somatic mutagens that are known to reach the gonadal compartments and expose germ cells, the chemical could be assumed to be a germ cell mutagen without further testing. Nevertheless, germ cell mutagenicity testing would be needed for quantitative risk assessment. (3) What new assays should be implemented and how? There is an immediate need for research on the application of whole genome sequencing in heritable mutation analysis in humans and animals, and integration of germ cell assays with somatic cell genotoxicity tests. Focus should be on environmental exposures that can cause de novo mutations, particularly newly recognized types of genomic changes. Mutational events, which may occur by exposure of germ cells during embryonic development, should also be investigated. Finally, where there are indications of germ cell toxicity in repeat dose or reproductive toxicology tests, consideration should be given to leveraging those studies to inform of possible germ cell genotoxicity.

Treatment recommendations based on the evidence are included and were reached unanimously by a panel of HL experts. Both autologous and allogeneic HCT offer a survival benefit in selected patients with advanced or relapsed HL and are currently part of standard clinical care. Relapse remains a significant cause of failure after both transplant approaches, and strategies to decrease the risk of relapse remain an important area of investigation.
25771415|Intensity-modulated radiotherapy, not 3 dimensional conformal, is the preferred technique for treating locally advanced lung cancer.|Chang, Joe Y; |2014 11 15|When used to treat lung cancer, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) can deliver higher dose to the targets and spare more critical organs in lung cancer than can 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy.

This article summarizes these strategies and reviews published findings supporting the safety and efficacy of IMRT for lung cancer.

We have provided our recommendations based on strength of evidence with the knowledge that ongoing clinical trials make this a dynamic field. Within this document, we discuss the decision to proceed with autologous HCT, factors to consider before proceeding to HCT, the role of tandem autologous HCT, post-HCT maintenance therapy, and the role of allogeneic HCT for patients with MM.
25645343|Role of partial nephrectomy as cytoreduction in the management of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.|Karam, J A; Babaian, K N; Tannir, N M; Matin, S F; Wood, C G; |2015 02 03|In this review, we describe the role, feasibility and safety of partial nephrectomy in the setting of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Partial nephrectomy is currently the preferred therapeutic modality in patients with localized renal tumors, while radical cytoreductive nephrectomy is the standard of care for appropriately selected patients with metastatic disease. Several studies have shown the prognostic value of percentage tumor removed when cytoreductive nephrectomy is done. This concept of percentage tumor removal and the associated benefit should also be applied when considering patients for cytoreductive partial nephrectomy; however, the potential adverse events after partial nephrectomy should be kept in mind, as these, when they occur, could delay time to starting systemic therapy. Several small retrospective studies have shown the feasibility of this approach in carefully selected patient groups. In well-selected patients with metastatic disease and primary tumors that are amenable to nephron sparing approaches, partial nephrectomy could offer an alternative to radical nephrectomy, with manageable adverse events, and good renal functional outcomes. Preserving renal function in this population could allow these patients to participate in clinical trial that they otherwise might not qualify for.

In less than a year, the Ebola virus (EBOV, Zaire ebolavirus species) has infected over 10,000 people, indiscriminately of gender or age, with a fatality rate of about 50%. Whereas at its onset this Ebola outbreak was limited to three countries in West Africa (Guinea, where it was first reported in late March 2014, Liberia, where it has been most rampant in its capital city, Monrovia and other metropolitan cities, and Sierra Leone), cases were later reported in Nigeria, Mali and Senegal, as well as in Western Europe (i.e., Madrid, Spain) and the US (i.e., Dallas, Texas; New York City) by late October 2014. World and US health agencies declared that the current Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak has a strong likelihood of growing exponentially across the world before an effective vaccine, treatment or cure can be developed, tested, validated and distributed widely. In the meantime, the spread of the disease may rapidly evolve from an epidemics to a full-blown pandemic. The scientific and healthcare communities actively research and define an emerging kaleidoscope of knowledge about critical translational research parameters, including the virology of EBOV, the molecular biomarkers of the pathological manifestations of EVD, putative central nervous system involvement in EVD, and the cellular immune surveillance to EBOV, patient-centered anthropological and societal parameters of EVD, as well as translational effectiveness about novel putative patient-targeted vaccine and pharmaceutical interventions, which hold strong promise, if not hope, to curb this and future Ebola outbreaks. This work reviews and discusses the principal known facts about EBOV and EVD, and certain among the most interesting ongoing or future avenues of research in the field, including vaccination programs for the wild animal vectors of the virus and the disease from global translational science perspective."

We hypothesized that decision aids also avoid discussion of costs, despite their being tools designed to facilitate shared decision making about patient-centered outcomes. We sought to define the frequency of cost-related information and identify the common modes of presenting cost and cost-related information in the 290 decision aids catalogued in the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute's Decision Aid Library Inventory (DALI) system. We found that 56% (n = 161) of the decision aids mentioned cost in some way, but only 13% (n = 37) gave a specific price or range of prices. We identified 9 different ways in which cost was mentioned. The most common approach was as a ""pro"" of one of the treatment options (e.g., ""you avoid the cost of medication""). Of the 37 decision aids that gave specific prices or ranges of prices for treatment options, only 2 were about surgery decisions despite the fact that surgery decision aids were the most common. Our findings suggest that presentation of cost information in decision aids is highly variable. Evidence-based guidelines should be developed by the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration."

Thus, strategies for cancer risk reduction would benefit from addressing multiple health risk behaviors. We adapted an evidence-based intervention grounded in social cognitive theory and principles of motivational interviewing originally developed for smoking cessation to also address physical activity and fruit/vegetable consumption among Latinos exhibiting multiple health risk behaviors. Literature reviews, focus groups, expert consultation, pretesting, and pilot testing were used to inform adaptation decisions. We identified common mechanisms underlying change in smoking, physical activity, and diet used as treatment targets; identified practical models of patient-centered cross-cultural service provision; and identified that family preferences and support as particularly strong concerns among the priority population. Adaptations made to the original intervention are described. The current study is a practical example of how an intervention can be adapted to maximize relevance and acceptability and also maintain the core elements of the original evidence-based intervention. The intervention has significant potential to influence cancer prevention efforts among Latinos in the United States and is being evaluated in a sample of 400 Latino overweight/obese smokers.
25483452|Clinical characteristics, pathophysiology, and management of noncentral nervous system cancer-related cognitive impairment in adults.|Wefel, Jeffrey S; Kesler, Shelli R; Noll, Kyle R; Schagen, Sanne B; |2014 12 05|Answer questions and earn CME/CNE Over the past few decades, a body of research has emerged confirming what many adult patients with noncentral nervous system cancer have long reported-that cancer and its treatment are frequently associated with cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI). The severity of CRCI varies, and symptoms can emerge early or late in the disease course. Nonetheless, CRCI is typically mild to moderate in nature and primarily involves the domains of memory, attention, executive functioning, and processing speed. Animal models and novel neuroimaging techniques have begun to unravel the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying CRCI, including the role of inflammatory cascades, direct neurotoxic effects, damage to progenitor cells, white matter abnormalities, and reduced functional connectivity, among others. Given the paucity of research on CRCI with other cancer populations, this review synthesizes the current literature with a deliberate focus on CRCI within the context of breast cancer. A hypothetical case-study approach is used to illustrate how CRCI often presents clinically and how current science can inform practice. While the literature regarding intervention for CRCI is nascent, behavioral and pharmacologic approaches are discussed.

In this Review we discuss the known biological effects of smoking on cancer cell biology and emphasise the clinical effects of continued smoking in patients with cancer treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Although evidence supports the need for inclusion of dedicated tobacco cessation efforts for patients with cancer, clinicians should consider the methods used to provide evidence-based tobacco cessation support and the available resources to deliver and maintain consistent tobacco cessation support. We also address the variables to consider in the design and implementation of a sustainable tobacco cessation programme.

The network includes >130 individuals from 65 community and academic organizations committed to reducing cancer-related health disparities. Using an empirically derived systems model--the Bergen Model of Collaborative Functioning--as the analytic frame, we interviewed 19 partners to identify challenges and successful processes. Findings indicated that sustained partner interaction created ""meaningful relationships"" that were routinely called on for collaboration. The leadership was regarded positively on vision, charisma, and capacity. Limitations included overreliance on a single leader. Suggestions supported more delegation of decision making, consistent communication, and more equitable resource distribution. The study highlighted new insights into dynamics of collaboration: Greater inclusiveness of inputs (partners, finances, mission) and loosely defined roles and structure produced strong connections but less network-wide productivity (output). Still, this profile enabled the creation of more tightly defined and highly productive subgroups, with clear goals and roles but less inclusive of inputs than the larger network. Important network outputs included practice-based research publications, cancer control intervention materials, and training to enhance the use of evidence-based interventions, as well as continued and diversified funding."
25358907|A unification of models for meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies without a gold standard.|Liu, Yulun; Chen, Yong; Chu, Haitao; |2014 10 30|Several statistical methods for meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies have been discussed in the presence of a gold standard. However, in practice, the selected reference test may be imperfect due to measurement error, non-existence, invasive nature, or expensive cost of a gold standard. It has been suggested that treating an imperfect reference test as a gold standard can lead to substantial bias in the estimation of diagnostic test accuracy. Recently, two models have been proposed to account for imperfect reference test, namely, a multivariate generalized linear mixed model (MGLMM) and a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model. Both models are very flexible in accounting for heterogeneity in accuracies of tests across studies as well as the dependence between tests. In this article, we show that these two models, although with different formulations, are closely related and are equivalent in the absence of study-level covariates. Furthermore, we provide the exact relations between the parameters of these two models and assumptions under which two models can be reduced to equivalent submodels. On the other hand, we show that some submodels of the MGLMM do not have corresponding equivalent submodels of the HSROC model, and vice versa. With three real examples, we illustrate the cases when fitting the MGLMM and HSROC models leads to equivalent submodels and hence identical inference, and the cases when the inferences from two models are slightly different. Our results generalize the important relations between the bivariate generalized linear mixed model and HSROC model when the reference test is a gold standard.

By testing different numbers of variants in independent studies, we show that the most strongly associated ∼2,000, ∼3,700 and ∼9,500 SNPs explained ∼21%, ∼24% and ∼29% of phenotypic variance. Furthermore, all common variants together captured 60% of heritability. The 697 variants clustered in 423 loci were enriched for genes, pathways and tissue types known to be involved in growth and together implicated genes and pathways not highlighted in earlier efforts, such as signaling by fibroblast growth factors, WNT/β-catenin and chondroitin sulfate-related genes. We identified several genes and pathways not previously connected with human skeletal growth, including mTOR, osteoglycin and binding of hyaluronic acid. Our results indicate a genetic architecture for human height that is characterized by a very large but finite number (thousands) of causal variants.
25275807|Promotion and provision of colorectal cancer screening: a comparison of colorectal cancer control program grantees and nongrantees, 2011-2012.|Maxwell, Annette E; Hannon, Peggy A; Escoffery, Cam; Vu, Thuy; Kohn, Marlana; Vernon, Sally W; DeGroff, Amy; |2014 10 02|Since 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has awarded nearly $95 million to 29 states and tribes through the Colorectal Cancer Control Program (CRCCP) to fund 2 program components: 1) providing colorectal cancer (CRC) screening to uninsured and underinsured low-income adults and 2) promoting population-wide CRC screening through evidence-based interventions identified in the Guide to Community Preventive Services (Community Guide). CRCCP is a new model for disseminating and promoting use of evidence-based interventions. If the program proves successful, CDC may adopt the model for future cancer control programs. The objective of our study was to compare the colorectal cancer screening practices of recipients of CRCCP funding (grantees) with those of nonrecipients (nongrantees).

The NCI's Population-Based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens (PROSPR) consortium is the first federal initiative to foster coordinated, transdisciplinary research evaluating the entire cancer screening process in community settings. PROSPR is creating a central data repository to facilitate research evaluating the breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening process across different patient populations, provider types, and delivery systems. Data are being collected and organized at the multiple levels in which individuals are nested (e.g., healthcare systems, facilities, providers, and patients). Here, we describe a conceptual model of the colorectal cancer screening process guiding data collection and highlight critical research questions that will be addressed through pooled data. We also describe the three research centers focused on colorectal cancer screening with respect to study populations, practice settings, and screening policies. PROSPR comprehensively elucidates the complex screening process through observational study, and has potential to improve care delivery beyond the healthcare systems studied. Findings will inform intervention designs and policies to optimize colorectal cancer screening delivery and advance the Institute of Medicine's goals of effective, efficient, coordinated, timely, and safe health care with respect to evidence-based cancer screening.
24876632|Grounding evidence-based approaches to cancer prevention in the community: a case study of mammography barriers in underserved African American women.|Highfield, Linda; Bartholomew, L Kay; Hartman, Marieke A; Ford, M Molly; Balihe, Philomene; |2014 05 29|When community health planners select an evidence-based intervention that has been developed and tested in one situation and adapt it for use in a different situation or community, best practice suggests needs assessment and formative research in the new setting. Cancer prevention planners who are interested in adopting and adapting evidence-based approaches need to base their choices on a sound understanding of the health or behavioral risk problem in which they mean to intervene. This requires a balancing act of weighing community information against a broader perspective from the scientific literature and using the combination to identify and adapt an evidence-based intervention program that is likely to be effective in the new setting. This report is a case study of a community and organizational assessment conducted as a foundation for selecting and recommending adaptation of an evidence-based intervention for improving mammography appointment attendance. We used an inductive sequential exploratory mixed-methods design to inform this process. The process provides a model for formative research grounding evidence-based practice for cancer control planners. Future studies that incorporate findings from needs assessment into the adaptation of the selected intervention program may promote the effective dissemination of evidence-based programs.
24799495|A personalized approach to assessing and managing pain in patients with cancer.|Hui, David; Bruera, Eduardo; |2014 05 05|Pain is one of the most common and distressing symptoms in patients with cancer. In this review, we discuss an evidence-based approach to personalized pain assessment and management. Recent insights into the pain expression pathway have led to a paradigm shift in pain management, allowing clinicians to deliver personalized treatments tailored to the individual's needs. Personalized pain management begins with systematic screening, followed by comprehensive pain assessment. Impeccable characterization of pain informs its etiology and the mechanism to guide treatment choices. Identification of modulators of pain expression such as psychological distress, alcoholism, substance use, and delirium allow clinicians to further tailor treatment recommendations. Documentation of a personalized pain goal provides an individualized response criterion. A multidimensional treatment plan is then formulated targeting the pain mechanism, etiologic factors, and modulators. Finally, longitudinal monitoring customized to the individual's needs allows clinicians to improve adherence and, ultimately, to optimize pain control over time.

24695900|Second-opinion pathologic review is a patient safety mechanism that helps reduce error and decrease waste.|Middleton, Lavinia P; Feeley, Thomas W; Albright, Heidi W; Walters, Ron; Hamilton, Stanley H; |2014 04 01|We have a crisis in health care delivery, originating from increasing health care costs and inconsistent quality-of-care measures. During the past several years, value-based health care delivery has gained increasing attention as an approach to control costs and improve quality. One proven way to control costs and improve the quality of health care is subspecialty pathologic review of patients with cancer before initiation of therapy. Our study examined the diagnostic error rate among patients with cancer treated at a tertiary care hospital and demonstrated the value of subspecialty pathologic review before initiation of treatment.
24681333|Defining and treating the spectrum of intermediate risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer.|Kamat, Ashish M; Witjes, J Alfred; Brausi, Maurizio; Soloway, Mark; Lamm, Donald; Persad, Raj; Buckley, Roger; Böhle, Andreas; Colombel, Marc; Palou, Joan; |2014 03 25|Low, intermediate and high risk categories have been defined to help guide the treatment of patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (Ta, T1, CIS). However, while low and high risk disease has been well classified, the intermediate risk category has traditionally comprised a heterogeneous group that does not fit into either of these categories. As a result, many urologists remain uncertain about the categorization of patients as intermediate risk as well as the selection of the most appropriate therapeutic option for this patient population. We review the current literature and clinical practice guidelines on intermediate risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer and, based on our findings, provide urologists with a better understanding of this heterogeneous risk group as well as practical recommendations for the treatment of intermediate risk patients.

23506397|Design of a randomized controlled trial for multiple cancer risk behaviors among Spanish-speaking Mexican-origin smokers.|Castro, Yessenia; Basen-Engquist, Karen; Fernandez, Maria E; Strong, Larkin L; Eakin, Elizabeth G; Resnicow, Ken; Li, Yisheng; Wetter, David W; |2013 03 18|Smoking, poor diet, and physical inactivity account for as much as 60% of cancer risk. Latinos experience profound disparities in health behaviors, as well as the cancers associated with them. Currently, there is a dearth of controlled trials addressing these health behaviors among Latinos. Further, to the best of our knowledge, no studies address all three behaviors simultaneously, are culturally sensitive, and are guided by formative work with the target population. Latinos represent 14% of the U.S. population and are the fastest growing minority group in the country. Efforts to intervene on these important lifestyle factors among Latinos may accelerate the elimination of cancer-related health disparities.

However, similar recommendations for screening and management of bone abnormalities among children and adolescents post-HSCT are not clearly defined. A review of the literature using PubMed, CINAHL, National Guideline Clearinghouse, and Cochrane Collection databases identified a paucity of reports specific to the management of bone abnormalities in children and adolescents post-HSCT. Although guidelines for evaluation of bone health in pediatric patients with cancer exist, none specifically address early screening and prevention. The purpose of this article is to provide a review of the literature on current evidence for age appropriate screening, prevention, and management of bone abnormalities in children post-HSCT and to present a clinical guideline for bone abnormalities in children post-HSCT used in a hospital-based outpatient center.

Each year, VTE affects about 300,000 to 600,000 people in the United States, and death is the first manifestation in one-fourth of this population.(1){Beckman, 2010 #79} Moreover, approximately 10% of the US population has genetic factors that increase their risk for developing thrombosis.(1) In addition to inherited disorders, factors that contribute to VTE include prolonged immobilization, trauma, surgery, cancer, and critically ill patients.(2) Routine assessment and prophylaxis are recommended in these groups to avoid DVT-related complications.(2) Anticoagulants are the mainstay of drugs used in DVT/PE prevention and treatment. Despite the availability of evidence-based guidelines for anticoagulant therapy, there is suboptimal implementation of DVT prophylaxis in hospitalized patients.(3) All anticoagulants are ""high-alert"" drugs, and judicious use is mandatory to prevent bleeding complications.(4) This review discusses treatment guidelines, monitoring, side effects, and reversal agents available for some anticoagulant drugs approved for VTE. Dissemination of the knowledge via pharmacy education programs significantly improves the adherence to VTE prophylaxis.(5) Understanding the clinical aspects of anticoagulant dispensing as presented in this review is hoped to facilitate implementation of the theoretical knowledge as well as evidence-based guidelines in order to maximize patient benefit."
