Evidence posits that maintaining optimal brain health earlier in life is crucial for preventing and managing brain aging-related disorders such as dementia/cognitive decline, depression, stroke, and anxiety. We advocate for a holistic approach that integrates medical, psychological, and social frameworks with culturally tailored interventions across the lifespan to promote brain health and overall mental well-being in aging adults across all communities. Furthermore, our statement underscores the significance of prevention, early detection, and intervention in identifying cognitive decline, mood changes, and related mental illness. Action should also be taken to understand and address the needs of communities that traditionally have unequal access to preventive health information and services. By implementing culturally relevant and tailored evidence-based practices and advancing research in geriatric psychiatry, behavioral neurology, and geroscience, we can enhance the quality of life for older adults facing the unique challenges of aging. This position statement emphasizes the intrinsic link between brain health and mental health in aging, urging healthcare professionals, policymakers, and a broader society to prioritize comprehensive strategies that safeguard and promote brain health from birth through later years across all communities. The AAGP Expert Panel has the goal of launching further activities in the coming months and years.|Brain health; late-life; life-course; neurology; prevention; psychiatry; well-being;

The Socioecological Model describes physical activity as involving a dynamic and reciprocal interaction between individual, social, and community factors. Community group-based walking programs and civic engagement interventions aimed at enhancing physical activity have been successful in rural communities but have not targeted all three socioecological levels. Public libraries can act as innovative public health partners in rural communities. However, challenges remain because rural libraries often lack the capacity to implement evidence-based health promotion programming. The goals of this study are (1) build the capacity for rural libraries to implement evidence-based health promotion programs, (2) compare changes in physical activity between a group-based walking program and a combined group-based walking and civic engagement program with rural residents, and (3) conduct an implementation evaluation.|Civic engagement; Comparative effectiveness trial; Physical activity; Rural; Walking;

Quality indicators (QIs) are standardised, evidence-based measures of healthcare quality that allow healthcare systems to track performance, identify gaps in healthcare delivery and inform areas of priority for strategic planning. Social structures and economic systems that allow for unequal access to power and resources that shape health and health inequities can be described through the social determinants of health (SDoH) framework. Therefore, granular analysis of healthcare quality through SDoH frameworks is required to identify patient subgroups who may experience health inequity. Given the high burden of disease of colorectal cancer (CRC) and well-defined cancer care pathways, CRC is often the first disease site targeted by health systems for quality improvement. The objective of this review is to examine how SDoH have been integrated into QIs for CRC surgery. This review aims to address three primary questions: (1) Have SDoH been integrated into the development, reporting and assessment of CRC surgery QIs? (2) When integrated, what measures and statistical methods have been applied? (3) In which direction do individual SDoH influence QIs outputs?|Colorectal surgery; HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION & MANAGEMENT; Health Equity; ONCOLOGY; Quality in health care; SURGERY;

The Adolescent Vaccination Program (AVP) is a multi-component intervention demonstrated to increase HPV vaccination rates in pediatric clinics through the implementation of six evidence-based strategies. The purpose of this study, conducted in Houston, Texas, from 2019-2021, was to adapt the AVP into an online decision support implementation tool for standalone use and to evaluate its feasibility for use in community clinics. Phase 1 (Adaptation) comprised clinic interviews (n = 23), literature review, Adolescent Vaccination Program Implementation Tool (AVP-IT) design documentation, and AVP-IT development. Phase 2 (Evaluation) comprised usability testing with healthcare providers (HCPs) (n = 5) and feasibility testing in community-based clinics (n = 2). AVP-IT decision support provides an Action Plan with tailored guidance on implementing six evidence-based strategies (immunization champions, assessment and feedback, continuing education, provider prompts, parent reminders, and parent education). HCPs rated the AVP-IT as acceptable, credible, easy, helpful, impactful, and appealing (≥80% agreement). They rated AVP-IT supported implementation as easier and more effective compared to usual practice (p ≤ 0.05). The clinic-based AVP-IT uses facilitated strategy implementation by 3-month follow-up. The AVP-IT promises accessible, utilitarian, and scalable decision support on strategies to increase HPV vaccination rates in pediatric clinic settings. Further feasibility and efficacy testing is indicated.|HPV vaccination; decision support; digital health; feasibility; implementation; pediatrics; usability;

The Behavioral Science Committee (BSC) of the Children's Oncology Group (COG), comprised of psychologists, neuropsychologists, social workers, nurses, physicians, and clinical research associates, aims to improve the lives of children with cancer and their families through research and dissemination of empirically supported knowledge. Key achievements of the BSC include enhanced interprofessional collaboration through integration of liaisons into other key committees within COG, successful measurement of critical neurocognitive outcomes through standardized neurocognitive assessment strategies, contributions to evidence-based guidelines, and optimization of patient-reported outcome measurement. The collection of neurocognitive and behavioral data continues to be an essential function of the BSC, in the context of therapeutic trials that are modifying treatments to maximize event-free survival, minimize adverse outcomes, and optimize quality of life. In addition, through hypothesis-driven research and multidisciplinary collaborations, the BSC will also begin to prioritize initiatives to expand the systematic collection of predictive factors (e.g., social determinants of health) and psychosocial outcomes, with overarching goals of addressing health inequities in cancer care and outcomes, and promoting evidence-based interventions to improve outcomes for all children, adolescents, and young adults with cancer.|behavioral science; late effects; pediatric cancer; psychosocial; quality of life; supportive care;

There is a critical need to provide evidence-based psychosocial care to parents and caregivers of children with cancer. Digital health interventions are important to address many barriers to in-person intervention delivery but are not widely used in pediatric psychosocial cancer care. The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the need for flexible, acceptable, and accessible psychosocial digital health interventions. The Electronic Surviving Cancer Competently Intervention Program (eSCCIP) is an innovative digital health intervention for parents and caregivers of children with cancer, delivered through a combination of self-guided web-based content and supplemented by 3 telehealth follow-up sessions with a trained telehealth guide. A Spanish language adaptation of eSCCIP, El Programa Electronico de Intervencion para Superar Cancer Competentemente (eSCCIP-SP), has been developed.

One barrier to delivering evidence-based interventions in SUTS is providers' misconception that treating tobacco use and non-nicotine substance use concurrently jeopardizes clients' substance-use recovery, although research indicates that it enhances support for recovery and relapse prevention. A total of 86 treatment providers employed in SUTS (i.e., 9 Federally Qualified Health Centers, 16 Local Mental Health Authorities (LMHAs), 6 substance-use treatment programs in LMHAs, and 55 stand-alone substance-use treatment centers) in Texas, USA, answered survey questions about their (1) thoughts about treating tobacco during substance-use treatment, and (2) delivery of the 5A's tobacco-use intervention (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange). Twenty-six providers and leaders were interviewed about attitudes toward tobacco-free workplace policies and tobacco dependence and the relative importance of treating tobacco (vs. other substance-use disorders) at their center. Providers who did not believe tobacco use should be addressed as soon as clients begin treatment (i.e., endorsed responses of after 1 year, it depends on the client, or never) had lower odds of Asking clients about their tobacco use (OR = 0.195), Advising clients to quit smoking (OR = 0.176), and Assessing interest in quitting smoking (OR = 0.322). Qualitative results revealed barriers including beliefs that clients need to smoke to relieve the stress of substance-use recovery, are disinterested in quitting, fears that concurrent treatment would jeopardize substance use, and limited resources; additional training and education resources was the key facilitator theme. The results demonstrate a critical need to eliminate barriers to tobacco-treatment provision for clients in SUTS through education to correct misperceptions, specialized training to equip providers with knowledge and skills, and resources to build center capacity. Integrating evidence-based smoking interventions into routine care is key to support the recovery efforts of clients in SUTS.|concurrent treatment; disadvantaged groups and tobacco-use disorder; mixed methods; provider perceptions; substance-use disorders;

The purpose of this study is to qualitatively examine the R = MC2 (Readiness = motivation × innovation specific capacity × general capacity) heuristic subcomponents in the context of implementing general and colorectal cancer screening (CRCS)-related practice changes in FQHCs. We conducted 17 interviews with FQHC employees to examine (1) experiences with successful or unsuccessful practice change efforts, (2) using approaches to promote CRCS, and (3) opinions about R = MC2 subcomponents. We conducted a rapid qualitative analysis to examine the frequency, depth, and spontaneity of subcomponents. Priority, compatibility, observability (motivation), intra- and interorganizational relationships (innovation-specific capacity), and organizational structure and resource utilization (general capacity) emerged as highly relevant. For example, organizational structure was described as related to an organization's open communication during meetings to help with scheduling procedures. The results contribute to understanding organizational readiness in the FQHC setting and can be helpful when identifying and prioritizing barriers and facilitators that affect implementation.|R = MC2; colorectal cancer screening; federally qualified health centers; implementation; innovation; organizational readiness; rapid qualitative analysis;

36925840|Applying Theory to Explain the Influence of Factors External to an Organization on the Implementation of an Evidence-Based Intervention.|Leeman, Jennifer; Wangen, Mary; Kegler, Michelle; Lee, Matthew; O'Leary, Meghan C; Ko, Linda K; Fernández, María E; Birken, Sarah A; |2022 05 26|Despite its widely acknowledged influence on implementation, limited research has been done on how the external environment (i.e., outer setting) determines when organizations adopt and implement new interventions. Determinant frameworks identify several outer setting-level factors such as funding streams, inter-organizational relationships, and peer pressure. However, these frameworks do not explain how or why outer-setting factors influence implementation. To advance research in this area, we argue for the importance of deriving theory-based propositions from organization theory to explain how outer setting factors influence organizations. Drawing on the work of the Organization Theory in Implementation Science (OTIS) project, we identified 20 propositions from five classic organization theories-Complexity Theory, Contingency Theory, Institutional Theory, Resource Dependence Theory, and Transaction Cost Economics. We then applied those propositions to hypothesize relationships among outer setting factors, implementation strategies, and implementation outcomes in five case studies of evidenced-based tobacco control interventions. The five case studies address the implementation of smoke-free policies, community health worker-led tobacco education and cessation programs, 5 A's (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, and Arrange), point-of-sale tobacco marketing policy interventions, and quitlines. The case studies illustrate how propositions may be used to guide the selection and testing of implementation strategies. Organization theories provide a menu of propositions that offer guidance for selecting and optimizing high-leverage implementation strategies that target factors at the level of outer setting. Furthermore, these propositions suggest testable hypotheses regarding the mechanisms underlying the influence of outer-setting factors on how and why organizations adopt and implement interventions.|cancer prevention and control; evidence-based interventions; implementation determinants; implementation strategies; organizational theory;

A multi-component tobacco-free workplace program implemented in Texas SUTCs educated providers on treating tobacco use with evidence-based medication (or referral) and counseling. This study examined how center-level changes in knowledge from pre- to post-implementation (i.e., over time) affected center-level behavioral changes in providers' provision of tobacco use treatment over time. Providers from 15 SUTCs completed pre- and post-implementation surveys (pre N = 259; post N = 194) assessing (1) perceived barriers to treating tobacco use, specifically, a lack of knowledge on treating tobacco use with counseling or medication; (2) receipt of past-year education on treating tobacco use with counseling or medication; and (3) their intervention practices, specifically, the self-reported regular use of (a) counseling or (b) medication intervention or referral with patients who use tobacco. Generalized linear mixed models explored associations between provider-reported knowledge barriers, education receipt, and intervention practices over time. Overall, recent counseling education receipt was endorsed by 32.00% versus 70.21% of providers from pre- to post-implementation; the regular use of counseling to treat tobacco use was endorsed by 19.31% versus 28.87% from pre- to post-implementation. Recent medication education receipt was endorsed by 20.46% versus 71.88% of providers from pre- to post-implementation; the regular use of medication to treat tobacco use was endorsed by 31.66% versus 55.15% from pre- to post-implementation. All changes were statistically significant (ps < 0.05). High versus low reductions in the provider-reported barrier of ""lack of knowledge on pharmacotherapy treatment"" over time were a significant moderator of effects, such that SUTCs with high reductions in this barrier were more likely to report greater increases in both medication education receipt and medication treatment/referral for patients who use tobacco over time. In conclusion, a tobacco-free workplace program implementation strategy that included SUTC provider education improved knowledge and resulted in increased delivery of evidence-based treatment of tobacco use at SUTCs; however, treatment provision rates-in particular, offering tobacco cessation counseling-remained less than desirable, suggesting that barriers beyond lack of knowledge may be important to address to improve tobacco use care in SUTCs. Moderation results suggest (1) differences in the mechanisms underlying uptake of counseling education versus medication education and (2) that the relative difficulty of providing counseling versus providing medication persists regardless of knowledge gains."|counseling; implementation science; knowledge barrier; medication; perceived barriers; pharmacotherapy; substance use treatment centers; tobacco cessation; tobacco use treatment; tobacco-free workplace programs;

However, there is a paucity of data on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), distress, and health behaviors in long-term myeloma survivors who are in stable remission after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT). In this cross-sectional study using data from 2 randomized controlled trials of survivorship care plans and internet-based self-management intervention in transplantation survivors, the primary objective was to measure HRQoL (using the Short Form-12, version 2.0 [SF-12 v2]), distress (using the Cancer- and Treatment-Related Distress [CTXD] instrument), and health behaviors of myeloma survivors in stable remission after AHCT. A total of 345 patients at a median of 4 years (range, 1.4 to 11 years) post-AHCT were included. The mean SF-12 v2 Physical Component Summary (PCS) score was 45.5 ± 10.5, and the mean Mental Component Summary (MCS) score was 51.3 ± 10.1, compared with US population norms of 50 ± 10 for both (P < .001 and P = .021 for PCS and MCS comparisons, respectively). Notably, neither reached the threshold for a minimal clinically important difference. Approximately one-third of the patients had clinically significant distress based on the CTXD total score, with distress reported by 53% of the patients in the Health Burden domain, by 46% in the Uncertainty domain, by 33% in the Finances domain, by 31% in the Family Strain domain, by 21% in the Identity domain, and by 15% in the Medical Demands domain. Preventive care guidelines were adhered to by 81% of the myeloma survivors; however, adherence to exercise and diet guidelines were relatively low, at 33% and 13%, respectively. Myeloma AHCT survivors in stable remission have no clinically meaningful worsening in physical functioning compared with the general population. Survivorship programs should address ongoing distress due to health burden, uncertainty, and finances in myeloma survivors, along with evidence-based targeted interventions for modifiable health behaviors, such as nutrition and exercise.|Autotransplantation; Multiple myeloma; Survivorship;

In the absence of interventions for e-cigarette cessation, we sought to understand how and why e-cigarette users attempt to quit on their own. Participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online crowdsourcing platform. Those who reported they had ever used e-cigarettes regularly and had attempted to quit e-cigarette use were eligible for participation. Measures included demographic characteristics, other tobacco product use, e-cigarette device characteristics, barriers to quitting e-cigarettes, and facilitators to quitting e-cigarettes. A content analysis was conducted on twotwo open-ended questions that asked about advice respondents had for others trying to quit vaping and resources they wished they had during their quit attempt. Descriptive analyses were performed (means/standard errors; frequencies/proportions). A total of 89.0% reported using an e-cigarette with nicotine, 20.2% reported a nicotine concentration of 4-6 mg/mL%, 32.8% reported using multiple flavors, and 77.7% reported using their e-cigarette every day or some days. The primary reason reported for wanting to quit e-cigarettes was health concerns (42.2%), and 56.7% reported trying to quit ""cold turkey"". During quit attempts, 41.0% reported intense cravings and 53.1% reported stress as a trigger. From the content analysis, the most commonly cited suggestion for those wanting to quit e-cigarettes was distractions/hobbies (19.9%), followed by reducing/tapering down nicotine (16.9%). Descriptive information on demographics, e-cigarette use, device characteristics, barriers, facilitators, and quit methods provides a first step in identifying factors that contribute to successful interventions designed for e-cigarette cessation."|cessation; interventions; vaping;

We used visual analytics to examine complex relationships among aging stroke survivors' comorbidities. These findings informed pre-adaptation of a component of the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program. Methods: Secondary analysis of 2013-2014 Medicare claims with stroke as an index condition, hospital readmission within 90 days (n = 42,938), and 72 comorbidities. Visual analytics identified patient subgroups and co-occurring comorbidities. Guided by the framework for reporting adaptations and modifications to evidence-based interventions, an interdisciplinary team developed vignettes that highlighted multimorbidity to customize the self-management program. Results: There were five significant subgroups (z = 6.19, p < .001) of comorbidities such as obesity and cancer. We constructed 6 vignettes based on the 5 subgroups. Discussion: Aging stroke patients often face substantial disease-management hurdles.

Removing the cancer label from these non-lethal cancers has been proposed as an expedient way to reduce potential physical, psychological and financial harm to patients. Such a nomenclatural change necessitates a multidisciplinary team effort by clinicians and pathologists. Genitourinary Pathology Society recently conducted a survey of its members, gauging their awareness of this controversy and their position on whether GG 1 prostate cancer should be reclassified. Most respondents (196, 81.7%) opposed removing the cancer label from GG 1 cancer, 33 (13.8%) supported a change in nomenclature, while 11 (4.6%) responded that they were uncertain. Of those who supported the reclassification, 17 (51.5%) supported the change for radical prostatectomy only, 4 (12.1%) for biopsy only, and 12 (36.4%) for both biopsy and radical prostatectomy. This survey results highlight the gap between pathologists and clinicians in whether GG 1 prostate cancer should be labeled as ""non-cancer,"" and calls for continued debates and conversations between pathologists and clinicians, and further studies on the biology, diagnostic reproducibility, and ideal management of GG 1 prostate cancer in order to make a more evidence-based decision for patients."|Grade group 1; Low grade; Nomenclature; Prostate cancer;

The case series and case reports we identified indicate that surgical MDT is a safe and feasible treatment option for well-selected patients with a small number of PCa metastases diagnosed via molecular imaging. It is difficult to draw evidence-based conclusions regarding the survival benefit of metastasectomy; however, metastasectomy might lead to a prostate-specific antigen response and could potentially delay systemic therapy in patients with oligometastatic PCa. Prospective studies incorporating novel imaging are needed to better establish the role of metastasectomy for patients with metastatic PCa.

Little is known about whether behavioral health providers are using brief interventions, including the evidence-based 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, and Arrange) for other tobacco use, or what provider factors may be associated with use of these interventions. The current study redressed this gap. Overall, 86 providers in Texas (9 Federally Qualified Health Centers, 16 Local Mental Health Authorities (LMHAs) that provide a broad range of mental and behavioral health services, 6 substance use treatment programs in LMHAs, and 55 stand-alone substance use treatment programs) took a survey assessing their beliefs regarding (1) patients' concerns about other tobacco use; (2) their desire to quit; (3) importance of intervening on other tobacco use with cessation counseling; (4) perceived skills to intervene; (5) knowledge of referral options for treatment. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the association between each factor and use of the 5As. Results showed that 70.9% of providers asked patients about other tobacco use status, 65.1% advised them to quit, 59.3% assessed quit interest, 54.7% assisted with a quit attempt, and 31.4% arranged a follow-up. Providers who believed patients were concerned about other tobacco use, recognized the importance of offering other tobacco use cessation counseling, believed they had the necessary skills to treat other tobacco use, and possessed knowledge of referral options, respectively, were more likely to deliver the 5As (ps < 0.05). Results add to a limited literature on provider intervention practices for other tobacco use in settings where behavioral health care is provided, highlighting the significance of provider beliefs, perceived skills, and referral knowledge to care delivery. Findings reveal opportunities to increase delivery of the 5As for other tobacco use to behavioral health patients and suggest provider factors that could be targeted to build this capacity.|behavioral health providers; beliefs about patients; concurrent use; mental health disorders; non-cigarette tobacco use; provider skills; referral knowledge; substance use disorders;

A literature review was performed on the following topics: evidence-based transfusions of blood components and pharmaceutical agents. Other topics reviewed included perioperative coagulation assessment and perioperative PBM. The Transfusion and Anaemia Expertise Initiative (TAXI) consortium published a consensus statement addressing haemoglobin (Hb) transfusion threshold in multiple subsets of patients. A multicentre trial (PlaNeT-2) reported a higher risk of bleeding and death or serious new bleeding among infants who received platelet transfusion at a higher (50 000/μl) compared to a lower (25 000/μl) threshold. Recent data support the use of a restrictive transfusion threshold of 25 000/μl for prophylactic platelet transfusions in preterm neonates. The TAXI-CAB consortium mentioned that in critically ill paediatric patients undergoing invasive procedures outside of the operating room, platelet transfusion might be considered when the platelet count is less than or equal to 20 000/μl and there is no benefit of platelet transfusion when the platelet count is more than 50 000/μl. There are limited controlled studies in paediatric and neonatal population regarding plasma transfusion. Blood conservation strategies to minimise allogenic blood exposure are essential to positive patient outcomes neonatal and paediatric transfusion practices have changed significantly in recent years since randomised controlled trials were published to guide practice. Additional studies are needed in order to provide practice change recommendations.|neonates; patient blood management; pediatrics;

Throughout patients' oncological journeys, they will likely receive one or more implantable devices for the administration of fluids and medications as well as management of various comorbidities and complications related to cancer therapy. Infections associated with these devices are frequent and complex, often necessitating device removal, increasing health care costs, negatively affecting quality of life, and complicating oncological care, usually leading to delays in further life-saving cancer therapy. Herein, the authors comprehensively review multiple evidence-based recommendations along with best practices, expert opinions, and novel approaches for the prevention of diverse device-related infections. The authors present many general principles for the prevention of these infections followed by specific device-related recommendations in a systematic manner. The continuous involvement and meaningful cooperation between regulatory entities, industry, specialty medical societies, hospitals, and infection control-targeted interventions, along with primary care and consulting health care providers, are all vital for the sustained reduction in the incidence of these preventable infections.|antimicrobials; cancer; device; infection; oncology; prevention;

This evidence-based practice guideline was developed in response to increasing use of alternative service delivery models for genetic counseling, specifically telephone and video-based genetic counseling (telehealth genetic counseling or THGC). A recent systematic evidence review (SER) compared outcomes of THGC with in-person genetic counseling and found that for the majority of studied outcomes, THGC was a non-inferior and comparable service delivery model. The SER results were used to develop this guideline. The current and anticipated future use of THGC, including the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, provides the context for this guideline. Recommendation: The Telehealth Practice Guideline author workgroup conditionally recommends telehealth genetic counseling, either via telephone or video, as a delivery method for genetic counseling. Depending on factors unique to individual healthcare systems and provider and patient populations, THGC may be the only service delivery model available or may be utilized in addition to other service delivery models including in-person genetic counseling. The evidence shows large desirable effects, minor undesirable effects, and increased equity for patients when THGC is available. THGC may reduce or remove existing barriers to patient access to genetic counseling, such as medical conditions and/or disabilities that may affect a patient's ability to travel, inflexible work or school schedules, and lack of reliable transportation, finances, or dependent care. THGC is likely acceptable to key groups impacted by its use and is feasible to implement. Certain patient populations may require additional resources or encounter more barriers in using telemedicine services in general. For these populations, THGC can still be a valuable option if solutions are available.|genetic counseling; guideline; service delivery model; telegenetics; telehealth; telemedicine; virtual care;

Yet, a gap remains on how to adapt evidence-based vaccine interventions for the in vivo competitive social media messaging environment and what strategies to employ to make vaccine messages go viral. Push-pull and RE-AIM dissemination frameworks guided our adaptation of a National Cancer Institute video-based HPV vaccine cancer control program, the HPV Vaccine Decision Narratives, for the social media environment. We also aimed to understand how dissemination might differ across three platforms, namely Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter, to increase reach and engagement. Centering theory and a question-answer framework guided the adaptation process of segmenting vaccine decision story videos into shorter coherent segments for social media. Twelve strategies were implemented over 4 months to build a following and disseminate the intervention. The evaluation showed that all platforms increased following, but Instagram and TikTok outperformed Twitter on impressions, followers, engagement, and reach metrics. Although TikTok increased reach the most (unique accounts that viewed content), Instagram increased followers, engagement, and impressions the most. For Instagram, the top performer, six of 12 strategies contributed to increasing reach, including the use of videos, more than 11 hashtags, COVID-19 hashtags, mentions, and follow-for-follow strategies. This observational social media study identified dissemination strategies that significantly increased the reach of vaccine messages in a real-world competitive social media messaging environment. Engagement presented greater challenges. Results inform the planning and adaptation considerations necessary for transforming public health HPV vaccine interventions for social media environments, with unique considerations depending on the platform.|HPV; HPV vaccine; engagement; implementation adaptation; social media; vaccine interventions;

Consequently, it is important that centers providing health care to this group mandate providers' use of tobacco screenings to inform the need for tobacco use disorder intervention. This study examined the prevalence of mandated tobacco screenings in 80 centers providing health care to Texans with behavioral health needs, examined key factors that could enhance screening conduct, and delineated providers' perceived barriers to tobacco use intervention provision. The results indicated that 80% of surveyed centers mandated tobacco use screenings; those that did were significantly more likely than those that did not to have a hard stop for tobacco use status in health records and were marginally more likely to make training on tobacco screening available to providers. The most widespread barriers to tobacco use disorder care provision were relative perceived importance of competing diagnoses, lack of community resources to refer patients, perceived lack of time, lack of provider knowledge or confidence, and belief that patients do not comply with cessation treatment. Overall, the results suggest that there are opportunities for centers providing care to Texans with behavioral health needs to bolster their tobacco screening and intervention capacity to better address tobacco-related health disparities in this group. Health care centers can support their providers to intervene in tobacco use by mandating screenings, streamlining clinical workflows with hard stops in patient records, and educating providers about the importance of treating tobacco with brief evidence-based intervention strategies while providing accurate information about patients' interest in quitting and providers' potential impacts on a successful quit attempt.|Texas; behavioral populations; cessation care; facilitators; health disparities; mental illness; perceived barriers; screening practices; substance abuse; tobacco screening;

Trials benefit society through scientific advancement and individual patients through trial participation. In fact, billions of dollars are spent annually in support of these benefits. Despite the massive investments, clinical trials often fail to accomplish their primary aims and trial enrollment rates remain low. Prior efforts to improve trial conduct and enrollment have had limited success, perhaps due to oversimplification of the complex, multilevel nature of trials. For these reasons, the authors propose applying implementation science to the clinical trials context. In this commentary, the authors posit clinical trials as complex, multilevel evidence-based interventions with significant societal and individual benefits yet with persistent gaps in implementation. An application of implementation science concepts to the clinical trials context as means to build common vocabulary and establish a platform for applying implementation science and practice to improve clinical trial conduct is introduced. Applying implementation science to the clinical trials context can augment improvement efforts and build capacity for better and more efficient evidence-based care for all patients and trial stakeholders throughout the clinical trials enterprise.|clinical trials; complex interventions; health services research; implementation science; quality improvement;

Reliable cancer-risk-predictive markers play an important role in enabling evidence-based decision making as well as providing mechanistic insight into the malignant conversion of precancerous lesions. The focus of this article is to review updates on markers that may predict the risk of oral premalignant lesions (OPLs) in developing into oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs), which can logically be discovered only by prospective or retrospective longitudinal studies that analyze pre-progression OPL samples with long-term follow-up outcomes. These risk-predictive markers are different from those that prognosticate the survival outcome of cancers after they have been diagnosed and treated, or those that differentiate between different lesion types and stages. Up-to-date knowledge on cancer-risk-predictive markers discovered by longitudinally followed studies will be reviewed. The goal of this endeavor is to use this information as a starting point to address some key challenges limiting our progress in this area in the hope of achieving effective translation of research discoveries into new clinical interventions.|DNA methylation; epigenetic; genetic mutation; long-term follow-up; risk assessment; translational study;

Community-engaged dissemination and implementation research (CEDI) emphasizes engaging stakeholders (e.g., community members, practitioners, community organizations, etc.) with diverse perspectives, experience, and expertise to provide tacit community knowledge regarding the local context, priorities, needs, and assets. Importantly, CEDI can help improve health inequities through incorporating unique perspectives from communities experiencing health inequities that have historically been left out of the research process. The community-engagement process that exists in practice can be highly variable, and characteristics of the process are often underreported, making it difficult to discern how engagement of community partners was used to improve implementation. This paper describes the community-engagement process for a multilevel, pragmatic randomized trial to increase the reach and impact of evidence-based tobacco cessation treatment among Community Health Center patients; describes how engagement activities and the resulting partnership informed the development of implementation strategies and improved the research process; and presents lessons learned to inform future CEDI research.|Community-engaged research; Health equity; Implementation science; Research-practice partnerships;

Too often implementation never or slowly occurs. The community-wide campaign intervention Tu Salud ¡Si Cuenta! has evidence of improving health outcomes related to chronic disease among low-income, Latinos. Using the RE-AIM Framework, this study examined if the scaled-up version of the intervention is associated with improvements in hypertension and obesity in 12 locations. Each element of the RE-AIM framework was examined. For ""Effectiveness,"" we examined outcomes overall and by implementing location. We used linear and logistic regression to assess if exposure in the intervention was associated with improvement in hypertension and weight loss. Participants were stratified into ""low exposure"" (2-3 outreach visits) vs. ""high exposure"" (4-5 outreach visits). Based on the RE-AIM Framework, the intervention ""reached"" its intended population of low-income Latinos, demonstrated ""effectiveness"" in improving hypertension and obesity, was ""adopted"" at a high level in all but one site, was ""implemented"" with fidelity to the intervention model with moderate success across locations, and showed high ""maintenance"" over time. For effectiveness specifically, we found that out of 5,019 participants, 2,508 (50%) had a baseline hypertensive blood pressure (BP) reading. Of the 2,508, 1,245 (49.9%) recovered to normal blood pressure or pre-hypertension stage by last follow-up. After adjusting for baseline BP and potential confounders in multivariable linear regression models, the high exposure group had significantly more reduction in systolic BP (adjusted mean difference in % change = -0.96; p = 0.002) and diastolic BP (adjusted mean difference in % change = -1.61; p < 0.0001) compared to the low exposure group. After controlling for baseline weight and other confounders, the high exposure group had significantly greater decrease in weight compared to the low exposure group (adjusted mean difference in % change = -1.28; p < 0.0001). Results from the multivariable logistic regression models indicated that compared to the low exposure group the high exposure group was more likely to achieve a clinically significant minimum 5% weight loss [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 2.97; p < 0.0001).

The aim of this study was to assess effectiveness of the intervention and implementation of the intervention in safety net clinics. The intervention was implemented through a non-randomized stepped wedge cluster hybrid study design with 19 Federally Qualified Health Centers and charity care clinics within the Greater Houston area. A multivariable generalized estimating equation logistic regression was conducted to examine mammography appointment adherence. A survey assessing Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research constructs was also conducted with clinic staff prior to adoption and eight weeks post implementation. One-sided t-tests were conducted to analyze mean score changes between the surveys. A total of 4402 women (baseline period = 2078; intervention period = 2324) were included in the final regression analysis. Women in the intervention period were more likely to attend or reschedule their mammography appointment (OR = 1.30; p < 0.01) than those in the baseline period receiving usual care. Women who completed the intervention were more likely to attend or reschedule their mammography appointment than those who did not complete the intervention (OR = 1.62; p < 0.01). The mammography appointment no-show rates for those in the baseline period, in the intervention period, and who completed the intervention were, respectively, 22%, 19%, and 15%. A total of 15 clinics prior to adoption and eight clinics completed the survey at 8 weeks post implementation A statistically significant mean score decrease was observed in Inner Setting and in two Inner Setting CFIR constructs, Culture-Effort, and Implementation Climate. While the intervention improved mammography appointment adherence, there are opportunities to further integrate Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research constructs.

These effects may be closely intertwined and cause prolonged morbidity and decreased quality of life after HCT. Here we provide a systematic review of male-specific late effects in a collaboration among transplantation physicians, endocrinologists, urologists, dermatologists, and sexual health professionals through the Late Effects and Quality of Life Working Committee of the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research and the Transplant Complications Working Party of the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation. We used a systematic review methodology to summarize incidence, risk factors, screening, prevention, and treatment of these complications and provide consensus evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice and future research. Most of the evidence regarding male GVHD is still based on limited data, precluding strong therapeutic recommendations. Therefore, we recommend systematic screening for male genital GVHD regularly and reporting of cases to large registries to allow for a better understanding. Future research also should address treatment, given the little published evidence currently available. Male-specific endocrine consequences of HCT include hypogonadism, which also may affect bone health. Given the scanty evidence, current recommendations for hormone substitution and/or bone health treatment are based on similar principles as for the general population. Following HCT, sexual health decreases, and this topic should be addressed at regular intervals. Future studies should focus on interventional strategies to address sexual dysfunction. Infertility remains prevalent in patients having undergone myeloablative conditioning, warranting the offer of sperm preservation for all HCT candidates. Most studies on fertility rely on descriptive registry analysis and surveys, underscoring the importance of reporting post-HCT conception data to large registries. Although the quality of evidence is low, the development of cancer in male genital organs does not seem more prevalent in HCT recipients compared with the general population; however, subsequent malignancies in general seem to be more prevalent in males than in females, and special attention should be given to skin and oral mucosa. Male-specific late effects, which likely are more underreported than female-specific complications, should be systematically considered during the regular follow-up visits of male survivors who have undergone HCT. Care of patients with male-specific late effects warrants close collaboration between transplantation physicians and specialists from other involved disciplines. Future research should be directed toward better data collection on male-specific late effects and on studies about the interrelationships among these late effects, to allow the development of evidence-based effective management practices.|Chronic graft-versus-host disease; Genital; Hematopoietic cell transplantation; Hypogonadism; Infertility; Late effects; Male-specific; Sexual dysfunction; Subsequent malignancies; Survivorship;

Patients in LMICs often rely on traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCIM) that is more familiar, less costly, and widely available. However, spheres of influence and tensions between conventional medicine and TCIM can further disrupt efforts in evidence-based cancer care. Integrative oncology provides a framework to research and integrate safe, effective TCIM alongside conventional cancer treatment and can help bridge health care gaps in delivering evidence-informed, patient-centered care. This growing field uses lifestyle modifications, mind and body therapies (eg, acupuncture, massage, meditation, and yoga), and natural products to improve symptom management and quality of life among patients with cancer. On the basis of this review of the global challenges of cancer control and the current status of integrative oncology, the authors recommend: 1) educating and integrating TCIM providers into the cancer control workforce to promote risk reduction and culturally salient healthy life styles; 2) developing and testing TCIM interventions to address cancer symptoms or treatment-related adverse effects (eg, pain, insomnia, fatigue); and 3) disseminating and implementing evidence-based TCIM interventions as part of comprehensive palliative and survivorship care so patients from all cultures can live with or beyond cancer with respect, dignity, and vitality. With conventional medicine and TCIM united under a cohesive framework, integrative oncology may provide citizens of the world with access to safe, effective, evidence-informed, and culturally sensitive cancer care.|alternative; and integrative medicine; cancer prevention; complementary; global health; health policy; survivorship;

This study aimed to compare disease outcomes of TUEB and cTURBT with focus on the different energy sources. Methods: A systematic search was performed using PubMed and Web of Science databases in June 2021. Studies that compared the pathological (detrusor muscle presence), oncological (recurrence rates) efficacy, and safety (serious adverse events [SAEs]) of TUEB and cTURBT were included. Random- and fixed-effects meta-analytic models and Bayesian approach in the network meta-analysis was used. Results: Seven randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and seven non-RCTs (NRCT), with a total of 2092 patients. The pooled 3- and 12-month recurrence risk ratios (RR) of five and four NRCTs were 0.46 (95% CI 0.29-0.73) and 0.56 (95% CI 0.33-0.96), respectively. The pooled 3- and 12-month recurrence RRs of four and seven RCTs were 0.57 (95% CI 0.25-1.27) and 0.89 (95% CI 0.69-1.15), respectively. The pooled RR for SAEs such as prolonged hematuria and bladder perforation of seven RCTs was 0.16 (95% CI 0.06-0.41) in benefit of TUEB. Seven RCTs (n = 1077) met our eligibility criteria for network meta-analysis. There was no difference in 12-month recurrence rates between hybridknife, laser, and bipolar TUEB compared with cTURBT. Contrary, laser TUEB was significantly associated with lower SAEs compared with cTURBT. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve ranking analyses showed with high certainty that laser TUEB was the best treatment option to access all endpoints. Conclusion: While NRCTs suggested a recurrence-free benefit to TUEB compared with cTURBT, RCTs failed to confirm this. Conversely, SAEs were consistently and clinically significantly better for TUEB. Network meta-analyses suggested laser TUEB has the best performance compared with other energy sources. These early findings need to be confirmed and expanded upon.|TUEB; TURBT; bladder cancer; en bloc; transurethral en bloc; transurethral resection;

The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched in February 2021 for studies of patients with UR after RC. Incidence and risk factors of UR were the primary endpoints. The secondary endpoint was survival outcomes in patients who experienced UR. Twenty-one studies, comprising 9,435 patients, were included in the quantitative synthesis. Orthotopic neobladder (ONB) diversion was associated with a decreased probability of UR compared to non-ONB (pooled OR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.31-0.61, P < 0.001) and male patients had a significantly higher risk of UR compared to female patients (pooled OR: 3.16, 95% CI: 1.83-5.47, P < 0.001). Among risk factors, prostatic urethral or prostatic stromal involvement (pooled HR: 5.44, 95% CI: 3.58-8.26, P < 0.001; pooled HR: 5.90, 95% CI: 1.82-19.17, P = 0.003, respectively) and tumor multifocality (pooled HR: 2.97, 95% CI: 2.05-4.29, P < 0.001) were associated with worse urethral recurrence-free survival. Neither tumor stage (P = 0.63) nor CIS (P = 0.72) were associated with worse urethral recurrence-free survival. Patients with UR had a 5-year CSS that varied from 47% to 63% and an OS - from 40% to 74%; UR did not appear to be related to worse survival outcomes. Male patients treated with non-ONB diversion as well as patients with prostatic involvement and tumor multifocality seem to be at the highest risk of UR after RC.

Given the potential adverse health consequences of red and processed meat and the limited knowledge on individuals' health-related values and preferences on the topic, such data would be useful in the development of recommendations regarding meat consumption. Methods and analysis: We will perform a cross-sectional mixed methods study. The study population will consist of adult omnivores currently consuming a minimum of three weekly servings of either unprocessed red meat or processed meat. We will explore participants' willingness to stop or reduce their unprocessed red meat, or their processed meat consumption through a direct-choice exercise. This exercise will consist of presenting a scenario tailored to each individual's average weekly consumption. That is, based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of the best estimate of the risk reduction in overall cancer incidence and cancer mortality, we will ask participants if they would stop their consumption, and/or reduce their average consumption. We will also present the corresponding certainty of the evidence for the potential risk reductions. Finally, we will measure their meat consumption three months after the interview and determine if they have made any changes to their average consumption. Ethics and dissemination: The research protocol was approved by the ethics committees in Canada (Research Ethics Board, Dalhousie University), Spain (Comitè Ètic d'Investigació Clínica de l'IDIAP Jordi Gol), Poland (The Bioethics Committee of the Jagiellonian University), and Brazil (National Research Ethics Commission). The study is based on voluntary participation and informed written consent.

Tobacco Use Disorder (TUD) is one of the most common substance use disorders in the world. Evidence-based treatment of TUD is effective, but treatment accessibility remains very low. A dearth of specially trained clinicians is a significant barrier to treatment accessibility, even within systems of care that implement brief intervention models. The treatment of TUD is becoming more complex and tailoring treatment to address new and traditional tobacco products is needed. The Council for Tobacco Treatment Training Programs (Council) is the accrediting body for Tobacco Treatment Specialist (TTS) training programs. Between 2016 and 2019, n = 7761 trainees completed Council-accredited TTS training programs. Trainees were primarily from North America (92.6%) and the Eastern Mediterranean (6.1%) and were trained via in-person group workshops in medical and academic settings. From 2016 to 2019, the number of Council-accredited training programs increased from 14 to 22 and annual number of trainees increased by 28.5%. Trainees have diverse professional backgrounds and work in diverse settings but were primarily White (69.1%) and female (78.7%) located in North America. Nearly two-thirds intended to implement tobacco treatment services in their setting; two-thirds had been providing tobacco treatment for 1 year or less; and 20% were sent to training by their employers. These findings suggest that the training programs are contributing to the development of a new workforce of TTSs as well as the development of new programmatic tobacco treatment services in diverse settings. Developing strategies to support attendance from demographically and geographically diverse professionals might increase the proportion of trainees from marginalized groups and regions of the world with significant tobacco-related inequities.|evidence-based practice; health care professional training; smoking cessation; tobacco dependence treatment;

Stakeholders provide organizational specific adaptions in evidence-based interventions to ensure effective adoption, implementation, and sustainability. Stakeholder engagement strategies involve building mutual trust, providing clear communication, and seeking feedback. Using constructs from the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and The International Association for Public Participation spectrum, a conceptual framework was created to guide stakeholder engagement in an evidence-based intervention to increase mammography appointment adherence in underserved and low-income women. A document review was used to explore the alignment of the conceptual framework with intervention activities and stakeholder engagement strategies. The results indicate an alignment with the conceptual framework constructs and a real-world application of stakeholder engagement in a mammography evidence-based intervention.

At that time, there had been significant advances in the diagnosis, work-up, surgical management, and available treatment options allowing for more optimal care of affected women. Despite these advances, the incidence of endometrial cancer as well as the deaths attributable to the disease have continued to rise; from 1987 to 2014 there has been a 75% increase in cases and almost 300% increase in endometrial cancer deaths. Fortunately, since then, there has been progress in the treatment of patients with endometrial cancer with increased utilization of molecular pathology, greater understanding of genetic predisposition, enhanced methods for lymph node assessment, a broader understanding of the efficacy of radiation and chemotherapy, and a more efficient approach to survivorship and surveillance.

It can be caused by the cancer itself or by certain therapies like surgery, radiation or chemotherapy. Opioids are the first line of treatment for moderate to severe cancer-related pain. Opioids alone or in combination with non-opioid analgesics and adjuvant medications are important components for pain management during the perioperative period for cancer patients. Opioids act on the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), which is expressed in cancer cells and non-malignant cells of the tumor microenvironment. Retrospective studies suggest an association between the expression of MOR in cancers and shorter survival. In addition, recent evidence suggests that opium use and prescription opioids can influence clinical oncological outcomes. In this review, we will summarize the clinical evidence regarding the effect of opioid administration and survival in patients with cancer as well as the current evidence involving MOR expression and cancer progression.|Cancer; Mu-opioid receptors; Opioids; Survival;

However, robust prospective clinical evidence is essential to guide a change in clinical practice. We explored the feasibility of conducting a randomised controlled trial to investigate the impact of total intravenous anaesthesia with propofol vs. inhalational volatile anaesthesia on postoperative outcomes of patients undergoing major cancer surgery. We undertook a randomised, double-blind feasibility and pilot study of propofol total intravenous anaesthesia or volatile-based maintenance anaesthesia during cancer resection surgery at three tertiary hospitals in Australia and the USA. Patients were randomly allocated to receive propofol total intravenous anaesthesia or volatile-based maintenance anaesthesia. Primary outcomes for this study were successful recruitment to the study and successful delivery of the assigned anaesthetic treatment as per randomisation arm. Of the 217 eligible patients approached, 146 were recruited, a recruitment rate of 67.3% (95%CI 60.6-73.5%). One hundred and forty-five patients adhered to the randomised treatment arm, 99.3% (95%CI 96.2-100%). Intra-operative patient characteristics and postoperative complications were comparable between the two intervention groups. This feasibility and pilot study supports the viability of the protocol for a large, randomised controlled trial to investigate the effect of anaesthesia technique on postoperative cancer outcomes. The volatile anaesthesia and peri-operative outcomes related to cancer (VAPOR-C) study that is planned to follow this feasibility study is an international, multicentre trial with the aim of providing evidence-based guidelines for the anaesthetic management of patients undergoing major cancer surgery.|TIVA; anaesthesia; cancer; intravenous anaesthesia; peri-operative outcomes; propofol; volatile;

Historically, anticoagulant therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), given for both initial and long-term treatment, has been the preferred approach recommended by practice guidelines. Most recently, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines indicate that the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) apixaban, edoxaban, or rivaroxaban are preferred for patients without gastric or gastroesophageal lesions. DOACs have been associated with an increased risk of major bleeding in patients with gastrointestinal and possibly genitourinary cancers, and DOACs should either not be used (especially in those with intact intraluminal tumors) or be used with caution in patients with these cancers. Fatal or life-threatening bleeding occurs with similar frequency with DOACs or LMWH, and most major bleeding with DOACs can be managed with transfusion and standard measures. The patient's willingness and ability to comply with LMWH injections, and their treatment preference, should also be considered. Patients with cancer who have VTE should be treated with anticoagulation for a minimum of 6 months. Anticoagulation should be continued indefinitely while cancer is active or under treatment or if there are persistent risk factors for recurrent VTE. This article summarizes the evidence from clinical trials of LMWH and DOACs that underpins the NCCN guideline recommendations, addresses several controversies and caveats regarding anticoagulant treatment, and offers evidence-based, practical suggestions on patient selection for treatment with DOACs. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Several randomized trials support the addition of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) to the therapeutic armamentarium for cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE). These agents come with unique risks and patient- and cancer-specific variables that must be evaluated during the course of a patient's cancer care. This narrative review discusses findings from clinical trials of low-molecular-weight heparin and DOACs for the treatment of cancer-associated VTE, evidence that supports the recent National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline recommendations. A personalized approach to treatment is proposed that addresses patient selection for treatment with DOACs, factors that influence efficacy and safety, controversies and caveats, and suggestions for their resolution in clinical practice.|Cancer-associated thrombosis; Malignancy; Treatment; Venous thromboembolism;

Those with limited health literacy often have difficultly navigating the health care environment, including navigating care across the cancer continuum (e.g., prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment). Evidence-based interventions to assist adults with limited health literacy improve health outcomes; however, little is known about health literacy interventions in the context of cancer and their impact on cancer-specific health outcomes. The purpose of this review was to identify and characterize the literature on health literacy interventions across the cancer care continuum. Specifically, our aim was to review the strength of evidence, outcomes assessed, and intervention modalities within the existing literature reporting health literacy interventions in cancer. Our search yielded 1036 records (prevention/screening n = 174; diagnosis/treatment n = 862). Following deduplication and review for inclusion criteria, we analyzed 87 records of intervention studies reporting health literacy outcomes, including 45 pilot studies (prevention/screening n = 24; diagnosis/treatment n = 21) and 42 randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental trials (prevention/screening n = 31; diagnosis/treatment n = 11). This literature included 36 unique interventions (prevention/screening n = 28; diagnosis/treatment n = 8), mostly in the formative stages of intervention development, with few assessments of evidence-based interventions. These gaps in the literature necessitate further research in the development and implementation of evidence-based health literacy interventions to improve cancer outcomes.|Cancer; Health literacy; Neoplasms; Oncology;

Evidence-based interventions have been identified to improve the uptake of CPC behaviors; however, they are often inconsistently implemented, affecting their reach and effectiveness. Patient navigation is an evidence-based approach to increasing CPC behaviors. Nevertheless, there are few navigation programs that use systematically developed implementation strategies to facilitate adoption, implementation, and maintenance, which affects uptake and outcomes. This article describes the development of a multifaceted implementation strategy designed to facilitate delivery of a CPC phone navigation program to increase breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening; human papillomavirus vaccination; and smoking cessation among 2-1-1 Texas helpline callers. Using implementation mapping, a systematic approach for developing implementation strategies, we designed a strategy that involved training 2-1-1 information specialists to deliver the program, developed online tracking and quality-monitoring (audit and feedback) systems, and developed and distributed protocols and other materials to support training and implementation. Through this iterative process and our collaboration with 2-1-1 Texas call centers, our project resulted in a comprehensive training program with a robust curriculum of pertinent program content, for which we identified core components and appropriate delivery modes that are culturally relevant to the population. The results of this study can be applied to the development of more systematic, transparent, and replicable processes for designing implementation strategies. The study also demonstrates a process that can be applied to other contexts and other CPC program implementation efforts.|behavior change; cancer prevention and control; community-based participatory research; health education; health promotion; health research; partnerships/coalitions; program planning and evaluation; quality assurance/quality improvement; tobacco prevention and control; training;

However, direct comparative data are not available to inform treatment decisions and/or guideline recommendations. Therefore, we performed network meta-analysis to indirectly compare the efficacy and safety of currently available treatments. Multiple databases were searched for articles published before June 2020. Studies that compared overall and/or metastasis-free and/or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival (OS/MFS/PSA-PFS) and/or adverse events (AEs) in nmCRPC patients were considered eligible. Three studies (n = 4117) met our eligibility criteria. Formal network meta-analyses were conducted. For MFS, apalutamide, darolutamide, and enzalutamide were significantly more effective than placebo, and apalutamide emerged as the best option (P score: 0.8809). Apalutamide [hazard ratio (HR): 0.85, 95% credible interval (CrI): 0.77-0.94] and enzalutamide (HR: 0.86, 95% CrI: 0.78-0.95) were both significantly more effective than darolutamide. For PSA-PFS, all three agents were statistically superior to placebo, and apalutamide emerged as the likely preferred option (P score: 1.000). Apalutamide (HR: 0.71, 95% CrI: 0.69-0.74) and enzalutamide (HR: 0.76, 95% CrI: 0.74-0.79) were both significantly more effective than darolutamide. For AEs (including all AEs, grade 3 or grade 4 AEs, grade 5 AEs, and discontinuation rates), darolutamide was the likely best option. Apalutamide and enzalutamide appear to be more efficacious agents for therapy of nmCRPC, while darolutamide appears to have the most favorable tolerability profile.

As we begin to recover from the pandemic, a cohesive international approach is needed, and guidance on how to resume endoscopy services safely to avoid unintended harm from diagnostic delays. The aim of these guidelines is to provide consensus recommendations that clinicians can use to facilitate the swift and safe resumption of endoscopy services. An evidence-based literature review was carried out on the various strategies used globally to manage endoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic and control infection. A modified Delphi process involving international endoscopy experts was used to agree on the consensus statements. A threshold of 80% agreement was used to establish consensus for each statement. 27 of 30 statements achieved consensus after two rounds of voting by 34 experts. The statements were categorised as pre-endoscopy, during endoscopy and postendoscopy addressing relevant areas of practice, such as screening, personal protective equipment, appropriate environments for endoscopy and infection control precautions, particularly in areas of high disease prevalence. Recommendations for testing of patients and for healthcare workers, appropriate locations of donning and doffing areas and social distancing measures before endoscopy are unique and not dealt with by any other guidelines.

Previous research on mental health disparities for SM cancer survivors has largely focused on adult survivors; however, studies are limited in the adolescent and young adult (AYA) population. This study's objective is to compare depression and anxiety symptoms between AYA, female cancer survivors who identify as an SM and those who identify as heterosexual. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of 1025 AYA survivors aged 18-40 years (2015-2017) was performed. Patients self-reported SM identification and depression and anxiety symptoms, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ8) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD7), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression tested associations between SM identification and depression and anxiety. Results: Sixty-four participants (6%) identified as an SM. In adjusted analyses, SM participants had 1.88 higher odds of anxiety (odds ratio [OR] 1.88, confidence interval [95% CI] 1.05-3.35, p = 0.033) compared with heterosexual participants. SM participants did not have significantly higher odds of depression (OR 1.36, CI 0.75-2.47, p = 0.31). More social support was significantly associated with lower odds of depression (OR 0.91, CI 0.89-0.93, p < 0.001) and anxiety (OR 0.93, CI 0.91-0.94, p < 0.001). Conclusions: AYA cancer survivors identifying as an SM had nearly twice the odds of anxiety, with social support that is protective for both anxiety and depression. While mental health screening is recommended throughout the cancer care continuum, these data support the need for reliable screening, clinician awareness of increased vulnerability in the AYA, SM survivor population, and clinician training on culturally competent care and generation of evidence-based interventions.|LGBTQ; anxiety; depression; mental health; sexual minority; survivorship;

Mailed fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) offers promise for increasing screening rates, but optimal strategies for implementation have not been well synthesized. In June 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention convened a meeting of subject matter experts and stakeholders to answer key questions regarding mailed FIT implementation in the United States. Points of agreement included: 1) primers, such as texts, telephone calls, and printed mailings before mailed FIT, appear to contribute to effectiveness; 2) invitation letters should be brief and easy to read, and the signatory should be tailored based on setting; 3) instructions for FIT completion should be simple and address challenges that may lead to failed laboratory processing, such as notation of collection date; 4) reminders delivered to initial noncompleters should be used to increase the FIT return rate; 5) data infrastructure should identify eligible patients and track each step in the outreach process, from primer delivery through abnormal FIT follow-up; 6) protocols and procedures such as navigation should be in place to promote colonoscopy after abnormal FIT; 7) a high-quality, 1-sample FIT should be used; 8) sustainability requires a program champion and organizational support for the work, including sufficient funding and external policies (such as quality reporting requirements) to drive commitment to program investment; and 9) the cost effectiveness of mailed FIT has been established. Participants concluded that mailed FIT is an effective and efficient strategy with great potential for increasing colorectal cancer screening in diverse health care settings if more widely implemented.|colorectal cancer (CRC); colorectal neoplasms; evidence based; fecal immunochemical test (FIT); mailed outreach;

The complaint of any symptoms of OAB, which is highly prevalent and affects overall QOL, often needs therapeutic interventions. When conservative therapy methods fail, the addition of medications is recommended. The most commonly used agents for the treatment of OAB are antimuscarinic drugs.

Studies were deemed eligible if they compared cancer-specific survival in patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder with and without pretreatment laboratoryabnormalities. Formal meta-analyses were performed for this outcome. The systematic review identified 36 studies with 23,632 patients, of these, 32 studies with 22,224 patients were eligible for the meta-analysis. Several preoperative hematologic biomarkers were significantly associated with cancer-specific survival as follows: neutrophil - lymphocyte ratio (pooled hazard ratio [HR]: 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-1.29), hemoglobin (pooled HR: 0.87, 95% CI 0.82-0.94), C-reactive protein (pooled HR: 1.44, 95% CI 1.26-1.66), De Ritis ratio (pooled HR: 2.18, 95% CI 1.37-3.48), white blood cell count (pooled HR: 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.07), and albumin-globulin ratio (pooled HR: 0.26, 95% CI 0.14-0.48). Several pretreatment laboratory abnormalities in patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder were associated with cancer-specific mortality. Therefore, it might be useful to incorporate such hematologic biomarkers into prognostic tools for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. However, given the study limitations including heterogeneity and retrospective nature of the primary data, the conclusions should be interpreted with caution.|Hematologic biomarker; Meta-analysis; Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder;

Selecting the appropriate therapy depends on the degree of field cancerization and the number of invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas. Other considerations include treatment efficacy, cost, side effects, and patient preference. Field therapies are preferred because they address clinically visible disease and subclinical atypia. However, lesion-directed therapies are useful for lesions that are more difficult to treat or those where a histologic diagnosis is required.

This in turn led to an alarming increase in breast cancer morbidity and mortality rates among the disadvantaged population. Methods: Intervention mapping, a systematic approach which guides researchers and public health experts in the development of comprehensive evidence-based interventions (EBIs) was used to plan a health education and health policy intervention to increase breast cancer screening and chemotherapy adherence among Iraqi and Syrian refugee women aged 30 and older who are residing in refugee camps within the Beirut district of Lebanon. Results: The generation of the logic model during the needs assessment phase was guided by an extensive review of the literature and reports published in peer-reviewed journals or by international/local organizations in the country to determine breast cancer incidence and mortality rates among refugee women of Syrian and Iraqi nationalities. The underlying behavioral and environmental determinants of the disease were identified from qualitative and quantitative studies carried out among the target population and also aided in assessing the sub-behaviors related to the determinants of breast cancer screening and chemotherapy completion as well as factors affecting policy execution to formulate performance objectives. We then developed matrices of change objectives and their respective methods and practical applications for behavior change at the intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, and societal levels. Both educational components (brochures, flyers) and technological methods (videos disseminated via Whats app and Facebook) will be adopted to apply the different methods selected (modeling, self-reevaluation, consciousness raising, persuasion, and tailoring). We also described the development of the educational and technological tools, in addition to providing future implementers with methods for pre-testing and pilot-testing of individual and environmental prototype components. Conclusion: The use of intervention mapping in the planning and implementation of holistic health promotion interventions based on information collected from published literature, case reports, and theory can integrate the multiple disciplines of public health to attain the desired behavioral change.|breast cancer; education; intervention mapping; policies; refugee women;

In the last few decades, testing algorithms have been implemented to support an optimal risk-oriented therapy, leading to a large improvement in overall survival. In addition, large scale genomic studies have identified multiple aberrations of prognostic significance that are not routinely tested by existing modalities. However, as chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are increasingly used in clinical management of hematologic malignancies, these abnormalities may be more readily detected. In this article, we have compiled a comprehensive, evidence-based review of the current B-ALL literature, focusing on known and published subtypes described to date. More specifically, we describe the role of various testing modalities in the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic relevance. In addition, we propose a testing algorithm aimed at assisting laboratories in the most effective detection of the underlying genomic abnormalities.|B-ALL; Chromosomal microarray Analysis; Diagnosis; FISH; NGS; Prognosis;

A cornerstone of many programs is the use of fresh fruits and vegetables, which may support increased intake of many food components, including carotenoids, to improve survivor health. However, most dietary carotenoids in the United States currently come from processed vegetables, and it is unclear if the emphasis on fresh fruits and vegetables common in cooking education programs is associated with the total carotenoid content of meals. The objective of this analysis is to examine the relationship between fresh produce usage, practices commonly taught in healthy home cooking classes, and the carotenoid content of prepared meals among 40 parents with school-aged children. This is a secondary analysis of an observational study examining the quality of home cooking practices using an evidence-based index of behaviors, the Healthy Cooking Index (HCI). Nutrition-optimizing cooking practices, as quantified by the HCI, were not associated with the carotenoid content of meals (r = -0.24, p = 0.13). Further, total fruit and vegetable content of meals was not associated with total carotenoids (r = 0.14; p = 0.38), indicating heterogeneity in the carotenoid profiles of foods used by this population. High-carotenoid meals tended to use more canned and/or frozen tomato and vegetable products, and carotenoid content was associated with meals with sugar (r = 0.32; p = 0.04), and servings of refined grains (r = 0.49; p < 0.01). Our findings indicate an opportunity to educate pediatric cancer survivors and families on the incorporation of high-carotenoid food products while reducing refined grain and sweetener intake through a tailored home cooking intervention.|cancer survivorship; carotenoids; food preparation; nutrition education;

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the available literature on this topic and develop recommendations for optimal pain management after oncological breast surgery. A systematic review using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis guidance with procedure-specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) methodology was undertaken. Randomised controlled trials assessing postoperative pain using analgesic, anaesthetic or surgical interventions were identified. Seven hundred and forty-nine studies were found, of which 53 randomised controlled trials and nine meta-analyses met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Quantitative analysis suggests that dexamethasone and gabapentin reduced postoperative pain. The use of paravertebral blocks also reduced postoperative pain scores, analgesia consumption and the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Intra-operative opioid requirements were documented to be lower when a pectoral nerves block was performed, which also reduced postoperative pain scores and opioid consumption. We recommend basic analgesics (i.e. paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) administered pre-operatively or intra-operatively and continued postoperatively. In addition, pre-operative gabapentin and dexamethasone are also recommended. In major breast surgery, a regional anaesthetic technique such as paravertebral block or pectoral nerves block and/or local anaesthetic wound infiltration may be considered for additional pain relief. Paravertebral block may be continued postoperatively using catheter techniques. Opioids should be reserved as rescue analgesics in the postoperative period. Research is needed to evaluate the role of novel regional analgesic techniques such as erector spinae plane or retrolaminar plane blocks combined with basic analgesics in an enhanced recovery setting.|analgesia; breast surgery; evidence-based medicine; pain; systematic review;

Although professional bodies currently advocate for indefinite cytology screening for women living with human immunodeficiency virus, these recommendations are based on expert opinion, not evidence-based. In the general population, women who have never had an abnormal cytology result can cease screening at age 65 years. This is due to the relatively low incidence of dysplasia in this group and the risk of false-positive results as women age, invasive follow-up testing, and destructive treatments of lesions that are unlikely to progress to cancer. What is unclear, however, is how human immunodeficiency virus-infected women over age 65 years who have no history of abnormal cytology should be screened to maximize benefit while reducing harms of overscreening. This is a crucial question, as women over age 65 years who are living with human immunodeficiency virus comprise a rapidly growing population.|acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); cervical cancer screening; cervical cytology; cervical dysplasia; epidemiology gynecology; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); human papillomavirus (HPV); infectious disease; postmenopausal; vaginal cytology; vaginal dysplasia; 
31654338|Explaining Chronic Illness and Self-Rated Health Among Immigrants of Five Hispanic Ethnicities.|Lo, Celia C; Adame, Jessica L; Cheng, Tyrone C; |2019 10 25|The largest racial/ethnic minority group in the United States, Hispanics, especially Hispanic immigrants, have been considered healthier than groups of other ethnicity (including Whites, the majority). However, chronic illnesses such as cancer and diabetes are often seen in this culturally, ethnically diverse group. The present study had two aims. First was to explain two health outcomes, which were presence of chronic illness (any of the five common conditions cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension, cancer, and/or diabetes/prediabetes) and self-rated health, in terms of links to certain factors in acculturation, social status, health, social support, and lifestyle. Second was to determine how uniform these links might be across five ethnic groups: Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Central/South American. We combined data from 17 years of the National Health Interview Survey (1999-2015) and subjected these secondary measures to logistic and linear regression, separately by ethnicity, to explain both outcomes. With few exceptions, results generally linked illness/health to the tested independent variables. Additionally, results confirmed ethnicity to moderate the outcomes' associations with the independent variables. Ethnicity-specific analysis showed the two outcomes to exhibit dissimilar relationships with certain independent variables across ethnic groups. Research that (as has been common) lumps together respondents whose Hispanic ethnicities may differ disregards some meaningful variation rather than accounting for it. In future research-and in subsequent evidence-based policy/practice development-all essential sociocultural factors, including ethnicity, should be carefully outlined, advancing good health for the entire Hispanic immigrant population.|Chronic illness; Hispanic ethnicities; Immigrants; Self-rated health;

Cancer rehabilitation clinicians, researchers, and policy makers could learn from the multidisciplinary specialty of palliative care, which has benefited from a growth strategy and has garnered national recognition as an important and necessary aspect of oncology care. The purpose of this article is to explore the actions that have increased the uptake and integration of palliative care to yield insights and multimodal strategies for the development and growth of cancer rehabilitation. After examining the history of palliative care and its growth, the authors highlight 5 key strategies that may benefit the field of cancer rehabilitation: 1) stimulating the science in specific gap areas; 2) creating clinical practice guidelines; 3) building clinical capacity; 4) ascertaining and responding to public opinion; and 5) advocating for public policy change. Coordinated and simultaneous advances on these 5 strategies may catalyze the growth, utilization, and effectiveness of patient screening, timely referrals, and delivery of appropriate cancer rehabilitation care that reduces disability and improves quality of life for cancer survivors who need these services.|evidence-based practice; neoplasms; policy; public opinion; rehabilitation; science;

The goal of this paper is to present the background, design and pilot of Project TEACH (Tobacco Education and Cessation in the Health System) developed to improve clinical practice by offering specialized training in the provision of smoking cessation interventions to care providers in community mental health centers in Texas. This is achieved through engaging the expertise of clinicians at the MD Anderson Cancer Center's Tobacco Treatment Program and disseminating this expertise to care providers by means of a novel tele-mentoring approach called Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes). Evaluation of our pilot ECHO training project demonstrated that the training was very well received and resulted in self-reported enhancement of the providers' professional practice. This is the first project to extend the collaborative ECHO model to train healthcare providers in smoking cessation. This approach has potential to reduce smoking rates among smokers with mental and behavioral health needs, and consequently contribute to the prevention of cancer and other chronic diseases in this vulnerable population.|Counseling; Health Psychology; Public Health Policy and Practice; mental health; tele-mentoring; tobacco cessation;

30277572|Improving patient and caregiver outcomes in oncology: Team-based, timely, and targeted palliative care.|Hui, David; Hannon, Breffni L; Zimmermann, Camilla; Bruera, Eduardo; |2018 09 13|Over the past decade, a large body of evidence has accumulated supporting the integration of palliative care into oncology practice for patients with advanced cancer. The question is no longer whether palliative care should be offered, but what is the optimal model of delivery, when is the ideal time to refer, who is in greatest need of a referral, and how much palliative care should oncologists themselves be providing. These questions are particularly relevant given the scarcity of palliative care resources internationally. In this state-of-the-science review directed at the practicing cancer clinician, the authors first discuss the contemporary literature examining the impact of specialist palliative care on various health outcomes. Then, conceptual models are provided to support team-based, timely, and targeted palliative care. Team-based palliative care allows the interdisciplinary members to address comprehensively the multidimensional care needs of patients and their caregivers. Timely palliative care, at its best, is preventive care to minimize crises at the end of life. Targeted palliative care involves identifying the patients most likely to benefit from specialist palliative care interventions, akin to the concept of targeted cancer therapies. Finally, the strengths and weaknesses of innovative care models, such as outpatient clinics, embedded clinics, nurse-led palliative care, primary palliative care provided by oncology teams, and automatic referral, are summarized. Moving forward, more research is needed to determine how different health systems can best personalize palliative care to provide the right level of intervention, for the right patient, in the right setting, at the right time.

We used Intervention Mapping (IM) to develop and adapt a theory- and evidence-based educational intervention targeting parents of Hispanic adolescents to increase HPV vaccination. Methods: We followed IM steps 1-6 to: (1) develop a logic model and identify modifiable factors associated with vaccination among Hispanic adolescents by conducting literature reviews, focus groups, and in-depth interviews with Hispanic parents; (2) develop outcomes, write performance objectives, and develop a matrix of change objectives; (3) develop and identify a program theme, program components, theoretical methods, and practical applications; (4) develop an intervention design plan; (5) develop implementation strategies; and (6) develop an evaluation plan. We completed Steps 1-6 for to develop an intervention targeting parents of females, and we followed the steps again to adapt the program once HPV vaccine recommendations included males. Results: The program Por Nuestras Hijas (For Our Daughters) included two components: a print fotonovela and a tailored interactive multimedia intervention (TIMI). The program utilized the methods tailoring, targeting, framing, anticipated regret, modeling, skill building, and education and counseling to target the following determinants: parental knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, skills, perceived benefits/barriers, perceived susceptibility, perceived norms, and outcome expectations as modifiable factors influencing HPV vaccination. Lay health workers implemented the program in community clinics. A logic model of change guided evaluation planning. We later adapted the outcome and intervention content for parents of Hispanic adolescent males and changed the theme to Por Nuestros Hijos (For Our Children). Throughout the development and adaptation processes, we relied on theory, empirical evidence, and new data to make decisions. Discussion: IM provided a systematic methodology for program development and adaptation. Tasks in each step built upon one another integrating findings from the literature, previous research, qualitative findings, and theory to develop two educational programs for parents to increase HPV vaccination. The systematic process allowed us to develop messages and materials targeting factors beyond HPV knowledge or awareness to create behavior change.|HPV vaccination; Hispanic adolescents; Intervention Mapping; intervention adaptation; intervention development;

However, the role of FCM in assessment of subsequent specimens is unclear. We developed an algorithm to reduce the number of low-yield FCM tests without significant impact on clinically meaningful results. Patients with hematologic malignancies were studied in a derivation cohort, and the following algorithm was developed: (1) cytology and FCM on all initial samples, (2) cytology on all subsequent samples, and (3) FCM on subsequent samples only if previous FCM was positive. A separate population served as the validation cohort. The derivation cohort included 197 patients representing 1157 cytology and 543 FCM samples. Common malignancies were B-Cell ALL (25.3%), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (29.4%), and Burkitt lymphoma (7.7%). In the derivation cohort, the algorithm yielded a sensitivity of 90.0% (95% CI, 81.2-95.6%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 98.9-100.0%). The validation cohort included 132 patients with 563 cytology and 602 FCM samples. In the validation cohort, the testing algorithm yielded a sensitivity of 87.5% (95% CI, 75.9-94.8%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 99.1-100.0%). Of the 15 samples that were missed by the algorithm, FCM findings did not impact patients' management because of known CNS disease (seven patients) or they were responding to treatment (eight patients). CSF testing in hematologic malignancies using the proposed algorithm presents an evidence-based approach to reduce the number of unnecessary FCM tests of CSF without compromising patient care.|Cerebrospinal fluid; Cytology; Flow cytometry; Hematological malignancies; Quality improvement;

Sexual risk-taking behaviors, including early sexual initiation, contribute to these public health problems. Over 35 sexual health evidence-based programs (EBPs) have been shown to reduce sexual risk behaviors and/or prevent teen pregnancies or STIs. Because more than half of these EBPs are designed for schools, they could reach and impact a considerable number of adolescents if implemented in these settings. Most schools across the U.S. and in Texas, however, do not implement these programs. U.S. school districts face many barriers to the successful dissemination (i.e., adoption, implementation, and maintenance) of sexual health EBPs, including lack of knowledge about EBPs and where to find them, perceived lack of support from school administrators and parents, lack of guidance regarding the adoption process, competing priorities, and lack of specialized training on sexual health. Therefore, this paper describes how we used intervention mapping (Steps 3 and 4, in particular), a systematic design framework that uses theory, empirical evidence, and input from the community to develop CHoosing And Maintaining Effective Programs for Sex Education in Schools (iCHAMPSS), an online decision support system to help school districts adopt, implement, and maintain sexual health EBPs. Guided by this systematic intervention design approach, iCHAMPSS has the potential to increase dissemination of sexual health EBPs in school settings.|adolescents; dissemination; evidence-based; intervention mapping; sexual health;

Following a review of current DCIS management protocols a more conservative approach has been suggested. Clinical trials have been introduced to evaluate the option of avoiding surgical intervention in a proportion of patients with DCIS defined as ""low-risk"" using certain clinicopathological criteria. These trials can potentially provide evidence-based models of active surveillance (with or without endocrine therapy) as a future management approach. Despite the undisputable fact of our need to address the obvious overtreatment of screen-detected DCIS, some important questions need to be considered regarding these trials including the eligibility criteria and definition of risk, the proportion of patient eligible for inclusion, and the length of time required for proper analysis of the trials' outcome in view of the long-term natural history of DCIS progression particularly the low-risk group. These factors can potentially affect the practicality and future impact of such trials. This review provides critical analysis of current DCIS management trials and highlights critical issues related to their practicality and the expected outcome."|Breast; DCIS; Duct carcinoma in situ; Management;

Yet cancer-related nutritional risk is sometimes overlooked or under-treated by clinicians, patients, and their families. The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) recently published evidence-based guidelines for nutritional care in patients with cancer. In further support of these guidelines, an ESPEN oncology expert group met for a Cancer and Nutrition Workshop in Berlin on October 24 and 25, 2016. The group examined the causes and consequences of cancer-related malnutrition, reviewed treatment approaches currently available, and built the rationale and impetus for clinicians involved with care of patients with cancer to take actions that facilitate nutrition support in practice. The content of this position paper is based on presentations and discussions at the Berlin meeting. The expert group emphasized 3 key steps to update nutritional care for people with cancer: (1) screen all patients with cancer for nutritional risk early in the course of their care, regardless of body mass index and weight history; (2) expand nutrition-related assessment practices to include measures of anorexia, body composition, inflammatory biomarkers, resting energy expenditure, and physical function; (3) use multimodal nutritional interventions with individualized plans, including care focused on increasing nutritional intake, lessening inflammation and hypermetabolic stress, and increasing physical activity.|Anorexia; Cachexia; Cancer; Malnutrition; Nutritional intervention; Sarcopenia;

Although of benign origin, osteoblastomas tend to behave more aggressively clinically than other benign tumors. Because of the low incidence of osteoblastomas, evidence-based treatment guidelines and high-quality research are lacking, which has resulted in inconsistent treatment. The goal of this study was to determine whether application of the Enneking classification in the management of spinal osteoblastomas influences local recurrence and survival time. METHODS A multicenter database of patients who underwent surgical intervention for spinal osteoblastoma was developed by the AOSpine Knowledge Forum Tumor. Patient data pertaining to demographics, diagnosis, treatment, cross-sectional survival, and local recurrence were collected. Patients in 2 cohorts, based on the Enneking classification of the tumor (Enneking appropriate [EA] and Enneking inappropriate [EI]), were analyzed. If the final pathology margin matched the Enneking-recommended surgical margin, the tumor was classified as EA; if not, it was classified as EI. RESULTS A total of 102 patients diagnosed with a spinal osteoblastoma were identified between November 1991 and June 2012. Twenty-nine patients were omitted from the analysis because of short follow-up time, incomplete survival data, or invalid staging, which left 73 patients for the final analysis. Thirteen (18%) patients suffered a local recurrence, and 6 (8%) patients died during the study period. Local recurrence was strongly associated with mortality (relative risk 9.2; p = 0.008). When adjusted for Enneking appropriateness, this result was not altered significantly. No significant differences were found between the EA and EI groups in regard to local recurrence and mortality. CONCLUSIONS In this evaluation of the largest multicenter cohort of spinal osteoblastomas, local recurrence was found to be strongly associated with mortality. Application of the Enneking classification as a treatment guide for preventing local recurrence was not validated.|EA = Enneking appropriate; EI = Enneking inappropriate; Enneking classification; WBB = Weinstein-Boriani-Biagini; local recurrence; osteoblastoma; primary spine tumor; prognostic factors; spinal oncology; surgical treatment; survival;

A systematic review of the literature was undertaken using broad search terms. Studies analyzing the impact of cooking behaviors across a range of disciplines were included. Experts in the field reviewed the resulting constructs in a small focus group. The model was developed from the extant literature on the subject with 59 studies informing 5 individual constructs (frequency, techniques and methods, minimal usage, flavoring, and ingredient additions/replacements), further defined by a series of individual behaviors. Face validity of these constructs was supported by the focus group.

However, the evidence base regarding how best to care for these patients remains limited due to their underrepresentation in cancer clinical trials. Pragmatic clinical trials represent a promising approach for enhancing the evidence base in geriatric oncology by allowing investigators to enroll older, frailer patients onto cancer clinical trials. These trials are more accessible, less resource intensive, and place minimal additional burden on participating patients. Additionally, these trials can be designed to measure endpoints directly relevant to older adults, such as quality of life, functional independence and treatment tolerability which are often not addressed in standard clinical trials. Therefore, pragmatic clinical trials allow researchers to include patients for whom the treatment will ultimately be applied and to utilize meaningful endpoints. Examples of pragmatic studies include both large, simple trials and cluster randomized trials. These study designs allow investigators to conduct clinical trials within the context of everyday practice. Further, researchers can devise these studies to place minimal burden on the patient, the treating clinicians and the participating institutions. In order to be successful, pragmatic trials must efficiently utilize the electronic medical record for data capture while also maximizing patient recruitment, enrollment and retention. Additionally, by strategically utilizing pragmatic clinical trials to test therapies and interventions that have previously shown efficacy in younger, fitter patients, these trials represent a potential mechanism to improve the evidence base in geriatric oncology and enhance care for older adults with cancer.|Aging; Cancer; Clinical Trial; Frail Older Adults; Geriatrics; Pragmatic Clinical Trials; Quality of Life;

While there are established guidelines for early detection of breast cancer in high-risk women who have not undergone RRM, there are less developed guidelines after RRM. We evaluated the schemes offered before and after RRS in internationally diverse high-risk clinics. An e-mailed survey was distributed to high-risk clinics affiliated with CIMBA. Overall, 22 centers from 16 countries responded. Pre RRS surveillance schemes overwhelmingly included breast imaging (primarily MRI) from 18 to 30 years and clinical breast exam (CBE) at 6-12 month intervals. For ovarian cancer, all but 6 centers offered semiannual/annual gynecological exam, transvaginal ultrasound, and CA 125 measurements. Post RRM, most centers offered only annual CBE while 4 centers offered annual MRI, primarily for substantial residual breast tissue. After RRSO only 4 centers offered specific gynecological surveillance. Existing guidelines for breast/ovarian cancer detection in BRCA carriers are being applied pre RRS but are not globally harmonized, and most centers offer no specific surveillance post RRS. From this comprehensive multinational study it is clear that evidence-based, long-term prospective data on the most effective scheme for BRCA carriers post RRS is needed.|BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers; Early detection; High-risk women; Risk-reducing surgery; Surveillance schemes;

The workshop questions and key outcomes were as follows. (1) Do genotoxicity and mutagenicity assays in somatic cells predict germ cell effects? Limited data suggest that somatic cell tests detect most germ cell mutagens, but there are strong concerns that dictate caution in drawing conclusions. (2) Should germ cell tests be done, and when? If there is evidence that a chemical or its metabolite(s) will not reach target germ cells or gonadal tissue, it is not necessary to conduct germ cell tests, notwithstanding somatic outcomes. However, it was recommended that negative somatic cell mutagens with clear evidence for gonadal exposure and evidence of toxicity in germ cells could be considered for germ cell mutagenicity testing. For somatic mutagens that are known to reach the gonadal compartments and expose germ cells, the chemical could be assumed to be a germ cell mutagen without further testing. Nevertheless, germ cell mutagenicity testing would be needed for quantitative risk assessment. (3) What new assays should be implemented and how? There is an immediate need for research on the application of whole genome sequencing in heritable mutation analysis in humans and animals, and integration of germ cell assays with somatic cell genotoxicity tests. Focus should be on environmental exposures that can cause de novo mutations, particularly newly recognized types of genomic changes. Mutational events, which may occur by exposure of germ cells during embryonic development, should also be investigated. Finally, where there are indications of germ cell toxicity in repeat dose or reproductive toxicology tests, consideration should be given to leveraging those studies to inform of possible germ cell genotoxicity.|Chromosome aberrations; Copy number variants; Gene; Genetic disease; Germ cell mutation; Reproductive health; mutation;

We hypothesized that decision aids also avoid discussion of costs, despite their being tools designed to facilitate shared decision making about patient-centered outcomes. We sought to define the frequency of cost-related information and identify the common modes of presenting cost and cost-related information in the 290 decision aids catalogued in the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute's Decision Aid Library Inventory (DALI) system. We found that 56% (n = 161) of the decision aids mentioned cost in some way, but only 13% (n = 37) gave a specific price or range of prices. We identified 9 different ways in which cost was mentioned. The most common approach was as a ""pro"" of one of the treatment options (e.g., ""you avoid the cost of medication""). Of the 37 decision aids that gave specific prices or ranges of prices for treatment options, only 2 were about surgery decisions despite the fact that surgery decision aids were the most common. Our findings suggest that presentation of cost information in decision aids is highly variable.

Thus, strategies for cancer risk reduction would benefit from addressing multiple health risk behaviors. We adapted an evidence-based intervention grounded in social cognitive theory and principles of motivational interviewing originally developed for smoking cessation to also address physical activity and fruit/vegetable consumption among Latinos exhibiting multiple health risk behaviors. Literature reviews, focus groups, expert consultation, pretesting, and pilot testing were used to inform adaptation decisions. We identified common mechanisms underlying change in smoking, physical activity, and diet used as treatment targets; identified practical models of patient-centered cross-cultural service provision; and identified that family preferences and support as particularly strong concerns among the priority population. Adaptations made to the original intervention are described. The current study is a practical example of how an intervention can be adapted to maximize relevance and acceptability and also maintain the core elements of the original evidence-based intervention. The intervention has significant potential to influence cancer prevention efforts among Latinos in the United States and is being evaluated in a sample of 400 Latino overweight/obese smokers.|Latinos; adaptation; health risk behavior; intervention;

The severity of CRCI varies, and symptoms can emerge early or late in the disease course. Nonetheless, CRCI is typically mild to moderate in nature and primarily involves the domains of memory, attention, executive functioning, and processing speed. Animal models and novel neuroimaging techniques have begun to unravel the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying CRCI, including the role of inflammatory cascades, direct neurotoxic effects, damage to progenitor cells, white matter abnormalities, and reduced functional connectivity, among others. Given the paucity of research on CRCI with other cancer populations, this review synthesizes the current literature with a deliberate focus on CRCI within the context of breast cancer. A hypothetical case-study approach is used to illustrate how CRCI often presents clinically and how current science can inform practice. While the literature regarding intervention for CRCI is nascent, behavioral and pharmacologic approaches are discussed.|breast neoplasms; chemotherapy; complications and late effects of therapy; psychological/behavioral oncology;

The network includes >130 individuals from 65 community and academic organizations committed to reducing cancer-related health disparities. Using an empirically derived systems model--the Bergen Model of Collaborative Functioning--as the analytic frame, we interviewed 19 partners to identify challenges and successful processes. Findings indicated that sustained partner interaction created ""meaningful relationships"" that were routinely called on for collaboration. The leadership was regarded positively on vision, charisma, and capacity. Limitations included overreliance on a single leader. Suggestions supported more delegation of decision making, consistent communication, and more equitable resource distribution. The study highlighted new insights into dynamics of collaboration: Greater inclusiveness of inputs (partners, finances, mission) and loosely defined roles and structure produced strong connections but less network-wide productivity (output). Still, this profile enabled the creation of more tightly defined and highly productive subgroups, with clear goals and roles but less inclusive of inputs than the larger network. Important network outputs included practice-based research publications, cancer control intervention materials, and training to enhance the use of evidence-based interventions, as well as continued and diversified funding."|Bergen model of collaborative functioning; collaboration; community–academic partnership; leadership; roles; sustainability; 
25358907|A unification of models for meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies without a gold standard.|Liu, Yulun; Chen, Yong; Chu, Haitao; |2014 10 30|Several statistical methods for meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies have been discussed in the presence of a gold standard. However, in practice, the selected reference test may be imperfect due to measurement error, non-existence, invasive nature, or expensive cost of a gold standard. It has been suggested that treating an imperfect reference test as a gold standard can lead to substantial bias in the estimation of diagnostic test accuracy. Recently, two models have been proposed to account for imperfect reference test, namely, a multivariate generalized linear mixed model (MGLMM) and a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model. Both models are very flexible in accounting for heterogeneity in accuracies of tests across studies as well as the dependence between tests. In this article, we show that these two models, although with different formulations, are closely related and are equivalent in the absence of study-level covariates. Furthermore, we provide the exact relations between the parameters of these two models and assumptions under which two models can be reduced to equivalent submodels. On the other hand, we show that some submodels of the MGLMM do not have corresponding equivalent submodels of the HSROC model, and vice versa. With three real examples, we illustrate the cases when fitting the MGLMM and HSROC models leads to equivalent submodels and hence identical inference, and the cases when the inferences from two models are slightly different. Our results generalize the important relations between the bivariate generalized linear mixed model and HSROC model when the reference test is a gold standard.|Diagnostic test; Generalized linear mixed model; Hierarchical model; Imperfect reference test; Meta-analysis;

Cancer prevention planners who are interested in adopting and adapting evidence-based approaches need to base their choices on a sound understanding of the health or behavioral risk problem in which they mean to intervene. This requires a balancing act of weighing community information against a broader perspective from the scientific literature and using the combination to identify and adapt an evidence-based intervention program that is likely to be effective in the new setting. This report is a case study of a community and organizational assessment conducted as a foundation for selecting and recommending adaptation of an evidence-based intervention for improving mammography appointment attendance. We used an inductive sequential exploratory mixed-methods design to inform this process. The process provides a model for formative research grounding evidence-based practice for cancer control planners.
