Contradiction in text review and apps rating: prediction using textual features and transfer learning.,"Aljrees, Turki; Umer, Muhammad; Saidani, Oumaima; Almuqren, Latifah; Ishaq, Abid; Alsubai, Shtwai; Eshmawi, Ala' Abdulmajid; Ashraf, Imran",2024-01-03,"Mobile app stores, such as Google Play, have become famous platforms for practically all types of software and services for mobile phone users. Users may browse and download apps via app stores, which also help developers monitor their apps by allowing users to rate and review them. App reviews may contain the user's experience, bug details, requests for additional features, or a textual rating of the app. These ratings can be frequently biased due to inadequate votes. However, there are significant discrepancies between the numerical ratings and the user reviews. This study uses a transfer learning approach to predict the numerical ratings of Google apps. It benefits from user-provided numeric ratings of apps as the training data and provides authentic ratings of mobile apps by analyzing users' reviews. A transfer learning-based model ELMo is proposed for this purpose which is based on the word vector feature representation technique. The performance of the proposed model is compared with three other transfer learning and five machine learning models. The dataset is scrapped from the Google Play store which extracts the data from 14 different categories of apps. First, biased and unbiased user rating is segregated using TextBlob analysis to formulate the ground truth, and then classifiers prediction accuracy is evaluated. Results demonstrate that the ELMo classifier has a high potential to predict authentic numeric ratings with user actual reviews.",38196956,10.7717/peerj-cs.1722,pubmed,Journal Article,Ensemble learning; Google apps rating; Opinion mining; Text mining; Transfer learning,No MeSH terms,"['38196956', '37362743', '33885375', '34624662', '32012107', '33037875', '25972309', '36246486', '34904955', '35275069', '34259639', '33118944', '31381501', '36969371', '33196454', '35010392', '36081021', '36149733', '32936078', '35099398', '29273575', '34106073', '34468323', '34914718', '37738085', '36084078', '34460922', '34546179', '32700147', '35503246', '35573342', '34383379', '35494867', '31162124', '36201385', '35639374', '35044318', '36287596', '35612887', '28389420', '36227634', '37261886', '27220371', '27480144', '31512580', '30702435', '35348467', '35133285', '36416875', '27913373', '34283034', '33879089', '28646889', '27520615', '34751198', '36719730', '35709334', '36493561', '36310157', '32663158', '31920160', '35617014', '24718852', '28659256', '30455172', '37705619', '30249581', '30368438', '35006083', '35681167', '35060912', '34726613', '33406100', '35436227', '33215348', '26268634', '29503751', '31529374', '27833070', '36857125', '34857035', '36518748', '33890859', '34009134', '32088140', '37463036', '35930432', '36469397', '30545806', '31636719', '34403768', '36223178', '34135009', '30672742', '28659254', '34391568', '37440305', '35544318', '35252957', '35262499', '35702424', '38196956', '38196956', '37362743', '33885375', '34624662', '32012107', '33037875', '34534081', '32357164', '24409142', '38196956', '38196956']"
GAN-based medical image small region forgery detection via a two-stage cascade framework.,"Zhang, Jianyi; Huang, Xuanxi; Liu, Yaqi; Han, Yuyang; Xiang, Zixiao",2024-01-02,"Using generative adversarial network (GAN) Goodfellow et al. (2014) for data enhancement of medical images is significantly helpful for many computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tasks. A new GAN-based automated tampering attack, like CT-GAN Mirsky et al. (2019), has emerged. It can inject or remove lung cancer lesions to CT scans. Because the tampering region may even account for less than 1% of the original image, even state-of-the-art methods are challenging to detect the traces of such tampering. This paper proposes a two-stage cascade framework to detect GAN-based medical image small region forgery like CT-GAN. In the local detection stage, we train the detector network with small sub-images so that interference information in authentic regions will not affect the detector. We use depthwise separable convolution and residual networks to prevent the detector from over-fitting and enhance the ability to find forged regions through the attention mechanism. The detection results of all sub-images in the same image will be combined into a heatmap. In the global classification stage, using gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) can better extract features of the heatmap. Because the shape and size of the tampered region are uncertain, we use hyperplanes in an infinite-dimensional space for classification. Our method can classify whether a CT image has been tampered and locate the tampered position. Sufficient experiments show that our method can achieve excellent performance than the state-of-the-art detection methods.",38166011,10.1371/journal.pone.0290303,pubmed,Journal Article,No keywords,"Humans; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Lung Neoplasms; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Uncertainty; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","['38166011', '36525713', '31002188', '32550134', '31978805', '34404963', '32447144', '30915386', '35829786', '36301699', '35994931', '33238866', '35684665', '34411966', '31119180', '16898468', '33428062', '35218053', '32012292', '37722388', '35746422', '36086632', '38083412', '35878483', '36522545', '37011426', '36906915', '36493595', '33045649', '33848755', '31732864', '22894441', '19527950', '37447624', '37896706', '31872002', '30719445', '32221797', '31309586', '33456451', '21992380', '32134949', '36587571', '35777084', '16898434', '37619572', '31547346', '19661736', '29286609', '33714900', '33278767', '34449305', '32492581', '34961814', '33890681', '36679410', '29903487', '19673208', '34891920', '31319946', '32120268', '33444255', '34469001', '27391780', '32621786', '36580822', '34715519', '30515286', '31112304', '23020972', '32556953', '28321787', '31465479', '32612486', '34649572', '35863123', '37050708', '38052611', '33039786', '32526536', '33604011', '36202023', '33260108', '30315368', '35709336', '35571726', '35522642', '35746964', '37139750', '29870364', '34864584', '36698291', '32030769', '33761478', '31451402', '33259647', '36542389', '30697765', '37069451', '38248989', '37939377', '37748176', '38166011', '38166011', '36525713', '31002188', '32550134', '31978805', '34404963', '34725417', '34355223', '34339369', '32012000', '31085444', '30906683', '30294726', '29870379', '29870364', '28732268', '27295695', '38166011', '38166011']"
Domain and Patient Adversarial Multi-Task Learning for Arrhythmia Classification.,"Charls, Dawnlicity; Shahin, Mostafa; Ahmed, Beena",No date,"Manual screening of electrocardiograms (ECGs) for heart arrhythmias by clinicians is time-consuming and labor-intensive. A machine learning model for the automated diagnosis of heart arrhythmia from ECG signals can facilitate improved diagnosis, greater accessibility and earlier intervention for patients. The potential of such models is limited however by the small size of clinical datasets available for training. Methods that can be trained with multiple datasets to classify heart arrhythmia are needed to overcome this problem.In this paper, we propose using adversarial multi-task learning (AMTL) to extract domain and patient invariant features from two electrocardiogram databases. We further investigated the influence of beat segmentation location and beat normalization on domain invariance. Our proposed methods were tested on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and the St Petersburg INCART 12-lead Arrhythmia Databases. The domain adversarial models achieved a higher accuracy and average F1 score than their counterparts without domain adversarial learning. In particular, the patient and domain adversarial model improved the F1 scores on the two tested databases from 70% and 74% to 77% each.Clinical Relevance-This establishes that adversarial multitask learning with multiple datasets and multiple adversarial tasks can improve the F1 score of arrhythmia classification.",38083287,10.1109/EMBC40787.2023.10340285,pubmed,Journal Article,No keywords,"Humans; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Machine Learning; Electrocardiography; Databases, Factual","['38083287', '31416542', '32142452', '26922592', '36210977', '36385144', '27775596', '30599317', '30538768', '36710067', '29717579', '32658786', '38266299', '31437884', '36921434', '34496312', '32388066', '36773553', '34077377', '31330925', '32946380', '37567144', '33017986', '33017998', '29852955', '28869899', '31195603', '37470489', '31932667', '37278886', '31737240', '31545750', '35705072', '35990162', '19863819', '30245122', '33588254', '33508772', '36772404', '24110670', '26285228', '32316133', '37116424', '33516949', '25570241', '37336244', '28729684', '31627019', '37858107', '33017989', '18585905', '30098452', '20510478', '37145258', '34960291', '35969555', '34956556', '26609386', '31232548', '35957162', '20729162', '31853698', '35227968', '37380385', '34218172', '31200900', '25680203', '34497664', '25306242', '29886261', '36650754', '37756278', '37040683', '37014879', '34007306', '21707989', '35432590', '34871837', '24960667', '32932129', '33017987', '24211921', '30337072', '34852002', '27686713', '36236496', '34450733', '35882225', '25570680', '29993470', '23457972', '30061754', '35636359', '28125072', '31728941', '35786545', '34194685', '35746232', '34110986', '31016934', '32498271', '38082768', '38306814', '38280254', '38083287', '38083287', '31416542', '32142452', '26922592', '36210977', '36385144', '38083287', '38083287']"

EfficientRMT-Net-An Efficient ResNet-50 and Vision Transformers Approach for Classifying Potato Plant Leaf Diseases.,"Shaheed, Kashif; Qureshi, Imran; Abbas, Fakhar; Jabbar, Sohail; Abbas, Qaisar; Ahmad, Hafsa; Sajid, Muhammad Zaheer",2023-11-30,"The primary objective of this study is to develop an advanced, automated system for the early detection and classification of leaf diseases in potato plants, which are among the most cultivated vegetable crops worldwide. These diseases, notably early and late blight caused by Alternaria solani and Phytophthora infestans, significantly impact the quantity and quality of global potato production. We hypothesize that the integration of Vision Transformer (ViT) and ResNet-50 architectures in a new model, named EfficientRMT-Net, can effectively and accurately identify various potato leaf diseases. This approach aims to overcome the limitations of traditional methods, which are often labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to inaccuracies due to the unpredictability of disease presentation. EfficientRMT-Net leverages the CNN model for distinct feature extraction and employs depth-wise convolution (DWC) to reduce computational demands. A stage block structure is also incorporated to improve scalability and sensitive area detection, enhancing transferability across different datasets. The classification tasks are performed using a global average pooling layer and a fully connected layer. The model was trained, validated, and tested on custom datasets specifically curated for potato leaf disease detection. EfficientRMT-Net's performance was compared with other deep learning and transfer learning techniques to establish its efficacy. Preliminary results show that EfficientRMT-Net achieves an accuracy of 97.65% on a general image dataset and 99.12% on a specialized Potato leaf image dataset, outperforming existing methods.

Deep learning-based 3D brain multimodal medical image registration.,"Deng, Liwei; Lan, Qi; Zhi, Qiang; Huang, Sijuan; Wang, Jing; Yang, Xin",2023-11-08,"Medical image registration is a critical preprocessing step in medical image analysis. While traditional medical image registration techniques have matured, their registration speed and accuracy still fall short of clinical requirements. In this paper, we propose an improved VoxelMorph network incorporating ResNet modules and CBAM (RCV-Net), for 3D multimodal unsupervised registration. Unlike popular convolution-based U-shaped registration networks like VoxelMorph, RCV-Net incorporates the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) during the convolution process. This inclusion enhances the feature map information extraction capabilities during training and effectively prevents information loss. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight and residual network module at the network's base, which enhances learning ability without significantly increasing training parameters. To evaluate the superiority of our registration model, we utilize evaluation metrics such as structural similarity (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), and mean square error (MSE). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed network structure outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, yielding better performance in multimodal registration tasks. Furthermore, generalization testing on databases outside of the training set has confirmed the optimal registration effectiveness of our model.",37938452,10.1007/s11517-023-02941-9,pubmed,Journal Article,Medical image; Multimodal; Registration; Unsupervised,"Deep Learning; Brain; Learning; Benchmarking; Databases, Factual; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","['37938452', '37202715', '36495750', '34505341', '37552487', '37343325', '35044073', '31309586', '36863157', '34289437', '38052089', '35714616', '37823748', '35462800', '34965854', '33078422', '34796526', '35239133', '37343570', '36775901', '36565359', '34148011', '33204701', '38006648', '36695158', '34261452', '35678952', '37966121', '36639550', '34053089', '37289193', '36057788', '33007105', '35046218', '36763566', '34054939', '37920059', '36906915', '37342954', '36970887', '30627709', '37285848', '34082880', '36226240', '31307019', '31366173', '36542402', '29404850', '35792292', '38228542', '32389928', '30138909', '36171468', '34621329', '30666723', '37960438', '33459243', '30716034', '38056409', '34415068', '35836126', '31077390', '35901003', '31484849', '35137305', '33993015', '32163817', '35880375', '35106778', '36738711', '32277478', '34742941', '30843824', '33890681', '32352197', '35640389', '36513986', '36757033', '37382206', '37913614', '29544790', '36975007', '32602963', '32166768', '37615845', '36880373', '32687608', '34199735', '36708286', '35655819', '36335751', '37957203', '36764130', '33020942', '35551234', '36739626', '35785776', '38353628', '37440581', '35349836', '37573723', '32949051', '38324893', '38276366', '38258590', '38257488', '37289600', '37989041', '37744470', '38276390', '37856261', '37938452', '37938452', '37202715', '36495750', '34505341', '37552487', '37343325', '31351389', '30430361', '17659998', '16689266', '11339743', '37938452', '37938452']"
"Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease by joining dual attention CNN and MLP based on structural MRIs, clinical and genetic data.","Qiang, Yan-Rui; Zhang, Shao-Wu; Li, Jia-Ni; Li, Yan; Zhou, Qin-Yi; , ",2023-10-05,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible central nervous degenerative disease, while mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a precursor state of AD. Accurate early diagnosis of AD is conducive to the prevention and early intervention treatment of AD. Although some computational methods have been developed for AD diagnosis, most employ only neuroimaging, ignoring other data (e.g., genetic, clinical) that may have potential disease information. In addition, the results of some methods lack interpretability. In this work, we proposed a novel method (called DANMLP) of joining dual attention convolutional neural network (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) for computer-aided AD diagnosis by integrating multi-modality data of the structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), clinical data (i.e., demographics, neuropsychology), and APOE genetic data. Our DANMLP consists of four primary components: (1) the Patch-CNN for extracting the image characteristics from each local patch, (2) the position self-attention block for capturing the dependencies between features within a patch, (3) the channel self-attention block for capturing dependencies of inter-patch features, (4) two MLP networks for extracting the clinical features and outputting the AD classification results, respectively. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods in the 5CV test, DANMLP achieves 93% and 82.4% classification accuracy for the AD vs. MCI and MCI vs. NC tasks on the ADNI database, which is 0.2%∼15.2% and 3.4%∼26.8% higher than that of other five methods, respectively. The individualized visualization of focal areas can also help clinicians in the early diagnosis of AD. These results indicate that DANMLP can be effectively used for diagnosing AD and MCI patients.",37925204,10.1016/j.artmed.2023.102678,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Alzheimer’s disease; Attention mechanism; Convolutional neural network; Multi-modality data; Multilayer perceptron,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neural Networks, Computer; Neuroimaging; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Cognitive Dysfunction","['37925204', '31837471', '36121183', '30654174', '34229061', '33398778', '31132373', '31491832', '30763637', '37019116', '29572601', '35636355', '35746389', '34249658', '35457373', '36525914', '32498641', '30340094', '32008517', '31989891', '38083225', '34627926', '37269680', '33735087', '34814936', '34676625', '35299163', '37879913', '35419720', '37703717', '26298855', '32477040', '36516516', '35908497', '28859825', '31853655', '36057187', '35398507', '30584016', '37939533', '32082407', '38342924', '32721906', '31841947', '35894542', '26572145', '35983528', '34118592', '34513992', '30245275', '35939481', '36729918', '29269320', '37139751', '29578038', '33588019', '32124697', '33504310', '28934923', '33939609', '26742127', '32663548', '35239494', '38143361', '35616643', '36370583', '30908241', '34547018', '35785662', '32220743', '37833700', '31631618', '36739819', '30475714', '35728368', '33918453', '38176576', '26265552', '34712461', '28260614', '34833710', '35965800', '29562503', '34343744', '23417832', '34891795', '37492469', '24634832', '38002245', '27410431', '26363784', '33471765', '36710670', '31877173', '37216716', '37129723', '28119818', '38059336', '37573721', '29970996', '36433486', '36539525', '37468538', '30455622', '37960407', '31825859', '34450858', '38109240', '37709003', '37883852', '38104173', '27898305', '38243275', '38346370', '38015665', '38245656', '38261494', '33936504', '37527297', '38273799', '33547343', '38042101', '35142026', '35103240', '35183061', '37450359', '38082666', '38045324', '38077590', '38100335', '38116762', '31417397', '36641934', '37991907', '38222263', '38104173', '37925204', '37925204', '31837471', '36121183', '30654174', '34229061', '33398778', '37925204', '37925204']"
SkinNet-INIO: Multiclass Skin Lesion Localization and Classification Using Fusion-Assisted Deep Neural Networks and Improved Nature-Inspired Optimization Algorithm.,"Hussain, Muneezah; Khan, Muhammad Attique; Damaševičius, Robertas; Alasiry, Areej; Marzougui, Mehrez; Alhaisoni, Majed; Masood, Anum",2023-09-06,"Background: Using artificial intelligence (AI) with the concept of a deep learning-based automated computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system has shown improved performance for skin lesion classification. Although deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have significantly improved many image classification tasks, it is still difficult to accurately classify skin lesions because of a lack of training data, inter-class similarity, intra-class variation, and the inability to concentrate on semantically significant lesion parts. Innovations: To address these issues, we proposed an automated deep learning and best feature selection framework for multiclass skin lesion classification in dermoscopy images. The proposed framework performs a preprocessing step at the initial step for contrast enhancement using a new technique that is based on dark channel haze and top-bottom filtering. Three pre-trained deep learning models are fine-tuned in the next step and trained using the transfer learning concept. In the fine-tuning process, we added and removed a few additional layers to lessen the parameters and later selected the hyperparameters using a genetic algorithm (GA) instead of manual assignment. The purpose of hyperparameter selection using GA is to improve the learning performance. After that, the deeper layer is selected for each network and deep features are extracted. The extracted deep features are fused using a novel serial correlation-based approach. This technique reduces the feature vector length to the serial-based approach, but there is little redundant information. We proposed an improved anti-Lion optimization algorithm for the best feature selection to address this issue. The selected features are finally classified using machine learning algorithms. Main Results: The experimental process was conducted using two publicly available datasets, ISIC2018 and ISIC2019. Employing these datasets, we obtained an accuracy of 96.1 and 99.9%, respectively. Comparison was also conducted with state-of-the-art techniques and shows the proposed framework improved accuracy. Conclusions: The proposed framework successfully enhances the contrast of the cancer region. Moreover, the selection of hyperparameters using the automated techniques improved the learning process of the proposed framework. The proposed fusion and improved version of the selection process maintains the best accuracy and shorten the computational time.",37761236,10.3390/diagnostics13182869,pubmed,Journal Article,deep

Effect of image resolution on automated classification of chest X-rays.,"Haque, Md Inzamam Ul; Dubey, Abhishek K; Danciu, Ioana; Justice, Amy C; Ovchinnikova, Olga S; Hinkle, Jacob D",2023-08-04,"Deep learning (DL) models have received much attention lately for their ability to achieve expert-level performance on the accurate automated analysis of chest X-rays (CXRs). Recently available public CXR datasets include high resolution images, but state-of-the-art models are trained on reduced size images due to limitations on graphics processing unit memory and training time. As computing hardware continues to advance, it has become feasible to train deep convolutional neural networks on high-resolution images without sacrificing detail by downscaling. This study examines the effect of increased resolution on CXR classification performance.",37547812,10.1117/1.JMI.10.4.044503,pubmed,Journal Article,chest X-ray; deep learning; image resolution; multitask classification; receptive field,No MeSH terms,"['37547812', '33018211', '37087944', '33937810', '36832235', '33808240', '34425544', '30730032', '35281798', '36789135', '33616887', '34842222', '34943421', '33080508', '36872839', '36350854', '36925620', '36277075', '33323271', '37818499', '35822170', '28254085', '36447948', '36421659', '32275586', '33733221', '30972585', '34847386', '34052882', '33799220', '33753962', '35462630', '35328294', '37348439', '33828610', '34395185', '35035591', '33420641', '34109106', '37094464', '36649367', '35213339', '37664701', '32211231', '36140486', '35585727', '36620146', '33971427', '31174100', '34067034', '33997112', '36611451', '36423531', '34248292', '36759636', '35013650', '30457991', '36624136', '34303169', '34869785', '37854097', '27589577', '37233906', '34459001', '33817014', '36767399', '36033768', '36968651', '32550254', '34795794', '37685310', '35192461', '33877975', '37571564', '33007112', '34418813', '36274315', '34231311', '32031937', '35847931', '37237603', '36611423', '32486140', '33594382', '37362724', '33711739', '32746106', '33691020', '29732269', '35634810', '33643491', '36243705', '34531005', '36515554', '35204418', '29994439', '34219975', '35683400', '37986726', '37829549', '37791108', '37737270', '37502627', '38232121', '37986725', '35816527', '38326501', '36854967', '37547812', '37547812', '33018211', '37087944', '33937810', '36832235', '33808240', '33937810', '33691020', '33447023', '33196064', '32788602', '32435698', '31831740', '31706792', '31467326', '30730032', '30457988', '30422093', '30251934', '29898829', '29888070', '29545529', '28436741', '26509294', '26017442', '37547812', '37547812']"
An automated framework for evaluation of deep learning models for splice site predictions.,"Zabardast, Amin; Tamer, Elif Güney; Son, Yeşim Aydın; Yılmaz, Arif",2023-06-23,"A novel framework for the automated evaluation of various deep learning-based splice site detectors is presented. The framework eliminates time-consuming development and experimenting activities for different codebases, architectures, and configurations to obtain the best models for a given RNA splice site dataset. RNA splicing is a cellular process in which pre-mRNAs are processed into mature mRNAs and used to produce multiple mRNA transcripts from a single gene sequence. Since the advancement of sequencing technologies, many splice site variants have been identified and associated with the diseases. So, RNA splice site prediction is essential for gene finding, genome annotation, disease-causing variants, and identification of potential biomarkers. Recently, deep learning models performed highly accurately for classifying genomic signals. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and its bidirectional version (BLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and its bidirectional version (BGRU) are promising models. During genomic data analysis, CNN's locality feature helps where each nucleotide correlates with other bases in its vicinity. In contrast, BLSTM can be trained bidirectionally, allowing sequential data to be processed from forward and reverse directions. Therefore, it can process 1-D encoded genomic data effectively. Even though both methods have been used in the literature, a performance comparison was missing. To compare selected models under similar conditions, we have created a blueprint for a series of networks with five different levels. As a case study, we compared CNN and BLSTM models' learning capabilities as building blocks for RNA splice site prediction in two different datasets. Overall, CNN performed better with [Formula: see text] accuracy ([Formula: see text] improvement), [Formula: see text] F1 score ([Formula: see text] improvement), and [Formula: see text] AUC-PR ([Formula: see text] improvement) in human splice site prediction. Likewise, an outperforming performance with [Formula: see text] accuracy ([Formula: see text] improvement), [Formula: see text] F1 score ([Formula: see text] improvement), and [Formula: see text] AUC-PR ([Formula: see text] improvement) is achieved in C. elegans splice site prediction. Overall, our results showed that CNN learns faster than BLSTM and BGRU. Moreover, CNN performs better at extracting sequence patterns than BLSTM and BGRU. To our knowledge, no other framework is developed explicitly for evaluating splice detection models to decide the best possible model in an automated manner. So, the proposed framework and the blueprint would help selecting different deep learning models, such as CNN vs. BLSTM and BGRU, for splice site analysis or similar classification tasks and in different problems.",37353532,10.1038/s41598-023-34795-4,pubmed,Journal Article,No keywords,"Humans; Animals; Caenorhabditis elegans; Deep Learning; RNA Splice Sites; Data Analysis; Genomics; RNA, Messenger","['37353532', '32704450', '35780100', '36849908', '36203144', '31349311', '35120138', '35007754', '37079128', '37853371', '32550561', '37930575', '32498641', '31976917', '38135939', '32696716', '38374416', '29668310', '34493371', '34749632', '36836230', '35419721', '30987229', '35676633', '35210482', '31881982', '28924576', '30419785', '34038367', '34635034', '34460538', '35627292', '35022039', '37968358', '37304005', '36042418', '35168083', '35663929', '31369390', '36409063', '38180830', '30477892', '35545738', '34156608', '37837040', '34221854', '36201724', '37925540', '33711543', '33980138', '37852485', '36029873', '29949959', '38020156', '31009682', '34435091', '36321557', '34206540', '33618777', '34782834', '34053009', '37828360', '34991439', '35418074', '37083973', '33244078', '33964886', '35290811', '36679646', '38045020', '29931149', '35248805', '34481184', '34656087', '36188335', '32211035', '35538084', '37904084', '35697814', '35283668', '35504218', '35194090', '32872384', '30591034', '28467317', '31292287', '32980530', '38179749', '29201938', '33572653', '35093537', '35785076', '31776335', '33740884', '38363487', '37817823', '34249602', '32366055', '33909264', '30616584', '36590844', '33601013', '35604489', '32345213', '37335511', '34055810', '37349483', '38266520', '37964128', '33859269', '38327475', '37758871', '38178985', '37979517', '36564724', '38008265', '38219066', '36411295', '38097641', '36590874', '38181943', '37471397', '36448678', '37340283', '38099958', '38016234', '37573471', '38067706', '38137524', '38347394', '37731038', '30324305', '38303473', '34363562', '38263442', '38302981', '38110705', '37999193', '38184352', '38272964', '38240567', '38054927', '36438685', '38292449', '38005645', '38233745', '37205456', '37607960', '36450838', '37018101', '35395006', '38041071', '36124094', '37770903', '37852788', '37980387', '38243034', '38154219', '36284146', '38278851', '38267081', '38002325', '38083542', '38365730', '37640744', '38268004', '38062773', '38030689', '38135126', '38375292', '38250243', '29453457', '37770945', '38227650', '38331957', '37752169', '38295472', '36882455', '38253642', '38329536', '37491454', '36264719', '38291046', '35365717', '38012793', '38305453', '37773895', '38177932', '37726349', '38079062', '37488600', '38169652', '33219335', '35304504', '38315595', '28111505', '36893090', '38268009', '33746612', '38217130', '38038889', '37962376', '37353532', '37353532', '32704450', '35780100', '36849908', '36203144', '31349311', '34493371', '34306171', '32637044', '31881982', '31349311', '30661751', '30591034', '30315276', '29931149', '29916015', '29859120', '29668310', '29234465', '27302911', '27252772', '26807151', '26496609', '23929620', '22508909', '21530232', '19299860', '16925838', '15564294', '15374869', '15285897', '11752248', '11222768', '10592170', '9377276', '37353532', '37353532']"
The multi-modal fusion in visual question answering: a review of attention mechanisms.,"Lu, Siyu; Liu, Mingzhe; Yin, Lirong; Yin, Zhengtong; Liu, Xuan; Zheng, Wenfeng",2023-05-30,"Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a significant cross-disciplinary issue in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing that requires a computer to output a natural language answer based on pictures and questions posed based on the pictures. This requires simultaneous processing of multimodal fusion of text features and visual features, and the key task that can ensure its success is the attention mechanism. Bringing in attention mechanisms makes it better to integrate text features and image features into a compact multi-modal representation. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the development status of attention mechanism, understand the most advanced attention mechanism methods, and look forward to its future development direction. In this article, we first conduct a bibliometric analysis of the correlation through CiteSpace, then we find and reasonably speculate that the attention mechanism has great development potential in cross-modal retrieval. Secondly, we discuss the classification and application of existing attention mechanisms in VQA tasks, analysis their shortcomings, and summarize current improvement methods. Finally, through the continuous exploration of attention mechanisms, we believe that VQA will evolve in a smarter and more human direction.",37346665,10.7717/peerj-cs.1400,pubmed,Journal Article,Attention; Attention mechanisms; Fusion; Multi-modal; VQA; Visual question answering,No MeSH terms,"['37346665', '33255994', '37379280', '35488285', '37362667', '37673579', '36441742', '32750794', '32833656', '36121943', '36100340', '35161790', '32872620', '34460390', '29993847', '32941156', '33175690', '36978771', '36446015', '35358054', '28945588', '30418897', '37783542', '35336415', '35721409', '34927063', '34770471', '35113862', '33385313', '34941499', '36038063', '34855584', '32316433', '34982673', '34283714', '32386178', '35130171', '37812550', '33714005', '38358867', '36684756', '32011250', '31484137', '34615894', '30835223', '37015503', '33817003', '34847029', '37556338', '32942720', '30624212', '36031991', '35214484', '35983132', '35727773', '36201513', '37896519', '33476268', '31395548', '34039273', '32861914', '36949119', '31107679', '37647277', '37220044', '32646419', '37432797', '37190427', '34478389', '30457565', '33501276', '34428156', '31535995', '37576120', '35634104', '36321557', '28574341', '36772095', '37256804', '32568717', '33974546', '37368813', '36202900', '31796387', '36423486', '36173773', '36679456', '31980104', '33733168', '32446943', '37410654', '34460761', '32340964', '34330253', '34441318', '35909819', '36574065', '37182321', '37093718', '36146161', '37050499', '35009620', '31562071', '37015361', '34300504', '34587013', '38261479', '37773902', '37818428', '34994727', '38352766', '38324151', '38273051', '38233710', '38192469', '38192459', '38192452', '38169813', '38077554', '38012340', '37942171', '37928011', '37896536', '37891244', '37848839', '37809869', '37765984', '37765839', '37705662', '37687941', '37664698', '37510009', '37346665', '37346665', '33255994', '37379280', '35488285', '37362667', '37673579', '36202900', '36100340', '36038063', '35494798', '35336380', '35161790', '33817003', '33255994', '32833656', '32750794', '31107679', '31034408', '30624212', '29993847', '27295650', '37346665', '37346665']"
Co-attention enabled content-based image retrieval.,"Hu, Zechao; Bors, Adrian G",2023-04-23,"Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) aims to provide the most similar images to a given query. Feature extraction plays an essential role in retrieval performance within a CBIR pipeline. Current CBIR studies would either uniformly extract feature information from the input image and use it directly or employ some trainable spatial weighting module which is then used for similarity comparison between pairs of query and candidate matching images. These spatial weighting modules are normally query non-sensitive and only based on the knowledge learned during the training stage. They may focus towards incorrect regions, especially when the target image is not salient or is surrounded by distractors. This paper proposes an efficient query sensitive co-attention1 mechanism for large-scale CBIR tasks. In order to reduce the extra computation cost required by the query sensitivity to the co-attention mechanism, the proposed method employs clustering of the selected local features. Experimental results indicate that the co-attention maps can provide the best retrieval results on benchmark datasets under challenging situations, such as having completely different image acquisition conditions between the query and its match image.",37163844,10.1016/j.neunet.2023.04.009,pubmed,Journal Article,Clustering; Co-attention; Content-based image retrieval,"Information Storage and Retrieval; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Diagnostic Imaging; Learning; Cluster Analysis","['37163844', '15493691', '29981490', '16121465', '29372327', '25155691', '17249404', '34517529', '31059441', '16871730', '27678255', '33249389', '16519356', '29544790', '20879602', '17497197', '17390989', '19524455', '25296409', '22353403', '19162679', '19682395', '27273091', '20376525', '31845429', '26259520', '22194244', '18787239', '17153950', '19926897', '16579386', '35496641', '10342174', '21626916', '19273018', '23035717', '18586627', '24480158', '32399717', '22531763', '26627175', '18999165', '19965011', '31121417', '26167385', '26736909', '37207397', '22514130', '37616039', '23649729', '30361935', '25246167', '36702987', '17076417', '16238066', '35791434', '21800188', '19162675', '23243462', '19546026', '25227014', '19494749', '23671578', '32479347', '19586822', '36772705', '34872010', '29147954', '27460071', '22529324', '36270093', '24494177', '21859616', '10810747', '32439386', '37068492', '25996728', '17022260', '37296349', '29480232', '32372771', '25991105', '28692995', '22155954', '17187961', '24361985', '15360928', '23858770', '26890880', '15495304', '34636634', '17990757', '21880571', '24951697', '15971911', '23846532', '17022278', '20703533', '17153949', '22925797', '20693107', '19083036', '37780058', '36515554', '16479815', '37447929', '38132695', '37566504', '38190676', '37065544', '38145530', '37896701', '37310844', '38300775', '37350885', '37163844', '31059441', '15493691', '29981490', '20376525', '18214614', '37163844', '15493691', '29981490', '16121465', '29372327', '25155691', '37163844', '20376525', '18214614', '37163844', '20376525', '18214614']"
A systematic comparison of deep learning methods for EEG time series analysis.,"Walther, Dominik; Viehweg, Johannes; Haueisen, Jens; Mäder, Patrick",2023-02-23,"Analyzing time series data like EEG or MEG is challenging due to noisy, high-dimensional, and patient-specific signals. Deep learning methods have been demonstrated to be superior in analyzing time series data compared to shallow learning methods which utilize handcrafted and often subjective features. Especially, recurrent deep neural networks (RNN) are considered suitable to analyze such continuous data. However, previous studies show that they are computationally expensive and difficult to train. In contrast, feed-forward networks (FFN) have previously mostly been considered in combination with hand-crafted and problem-specific feature extractions, such as short time Fourier and discrete wavelet transform. A sought-after are easily applicable methods that efficiently analyze raw data to remove the need for problem-specific adaptations. In this work, we systematically compare RNN and FFN topologies as well as advanced architectural concepts on multiple datasets with the same data preprocessing pipeline. We examine the behavior of those approaches to provide an update and guideline for researchers who deal with automated analysis of EEG time series data. To ensure that the results are meaningful, it is important to compare the presented approaches while keeping the same experimental setup, which to our knowledge was never done before. This paper is a first step toward a fairer comparison of different methodologies with EEG time series data. Our results indicate that a recurrent LSTM architecture with attention performs best on less complex tasks, while the temporal convolutional network (TCN) outperforms all the recurrent architectures on the most complex dataset yielding a 8.61% accuracy improvement. In general, we found the attention mechanism to substantially improve classification results of RNNs. Toward a light-weight and online learning-ready approach, we found extreme learning machines (ELM) to yield comparable results for the less complex tasks.",36911074,10.3389/fninf.2023.1067095,pubmed,Journal Article,attention; feed forward neural networks; recurrent neural networks; time series analysis; transformer networks,No MeSH terms,"['36911074', '35303579', '30626132', '30808014', '30440769', '36706617', '35571721', '34656864', '32525885', '34305540', '33233358', '32575708', '35081524', '34891466', '30440405', '34843893', '31151119', '33380334', '31251191', '35914032', '29182152', '35607612', '35780100', '35457080', '31034417', '36556313', '34899212', '31924842', '36433422', '31836728', '36560113', '34122031', '34206540', '28952940', '34563599', '33101533', '35988771', '33424547', '34248481', '26797612', '30477892', '33018021', '34147756', '33036834', '28254085', '30685634', '33588711', '30440666', '33900927', '28748400', '30891794', '32327965', '36704007', '33395676', '34388736', '36525915', '32149700', '35957417', '36146421', '35968483', '36459884', '31055181', '30524056', '31586788', '33459255', '36836230', '32866745', '34721533', '35666790', '32730917', '33854642', '31416059', '33841094', '34170979', '33406048', '34543892', '35336432', '33823315', '35591209', '29796778', '29351262', '30472579', '30548601', '36365785', '33378260', '35537407', '33652697', '33945075', '33120386', '28778851', '36196623', '30440693', '38192484', '38231823', '36725658', '35133959', '37214954', '38215332', '37506054', '37369708', '37654692', '36911074', '35303579', '30626132', '30808014', '30440769', '35988771', '36911074', '35303579', '30626132', '30808014', '30440769', '36706617', '35615277', '35527819', '35455118', '33823091', '33684278', '33502984', '32327966', '32248008', '31831433', '31795445', '30951472', '30808014', '30682710', '30640634', '30443419', '28966996', '27900952', '27588002', '27337730', '26422421', '25834104', '19304486', '17517492', '17142543', '16496436', '15188875', '9377276', '36911074', '30808014', '35988771', '33588711', '34827524', '36911074', '30808014', '35988771', '33588711', '34827524']"
Chemical identification and indexing in full-text articles: an overview of the NLM-Chem track at BioCreative VII.,"Leaman, Robert; Islamaj, Rezarta; Adams, Virginia; Alliheedi, Mohammed A; Almeida, João Rafael; Antunes, Rui; Bevan, Robert; Chang, Yung-Chun; Erdengasileng, Arslan; Hodgskiss, Matthew; Ida, Ryuki; Kim, Hyunjae; Li, Keqiao; Mercer, Robert E; Mertová, Lukrécia; Mobasher, Ghadeer; Shin, Hoo-Chang; Sung, Mujeen; Tsujimura, Tomoki; Yeh, Wen-Chao; Lu, Zhiyong",No date,"The BioCreative National Library of Medicine (NLM)-Chem track calls for a community effort to fine-tune automated recognition of chemical names in the biomedical literature. Chemicals are one of the most searched biomedical entities in PubMed, and-as highlighted during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic-their identification may significantly advance research in multiple biomedical subfields. While previous community challenges focused on identifying chemical names mentioned in titles and abstracts, the full text contains valuable additional detail. We, therefore, organized the BioCreative NLM-Chem track as a community effort to address automated chemical entity recognition in full-text articles. The track consisted of two tasks: (i) chemical identification and (ii) chemical indexing. The chemical identification task required predicting all chemicals mentioned in recently published full-text articles, both span [i.e. named entity recognition (NER)] and normalization (i.e. entity linking), using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). The chemical indexing task required identifying which chemicals reflect topics for each article and should therefore appear in the listing of MeSH terms for the document in the MEDLINE article indexing. This manuscript summarizes the BioCreative NLM-Chem track and post-challenge experiments. We received a total of 85 submissions from 17 teams worldwide. The highest performance achieved for the chemical identification task was 0.8672 F-score (0.8759 precision and 0.8587 recall) for strict NER performance and 0.8136 F-score (0.8621 precision and 0.7702 recall) for strict normalization performance. The highest performance achieved for the chemical indexing task was 0.6073 F-score (0.7417 precision and 0.5141 recall). This community challenge demonstrated that (i) the current substantial achievements in deep learning technologies can be utilized to improve automated prediction accuracy further and (ii) the chemical indexing task is substantially more challenging. We look forward to further developing biomedical text-mining methods to respond to the rapid growth of biomedical literature.

Tiller estimation method using deep neural networks.,"Kinose, Rikuya; Utsumi, Yuzuko; Iwamura, Masakazu; Kise, Koichi",2023-01-13,"This paper describes a method based on a deep neural network (DNN) for estimating the number of tillers on a plant. A tiller is a branch on a grass plant, and the number of tillers is one of the most important determinants of yield. Traditionally, the tiller number is usually counted by hand, and so an automated approach is necessary for high-throughput phenotyping. Conventional methods use heuristic features to estimate the tiller number. Based on the successful application of DNNs in the field of computer vision, the use of DNN-based features instead of heuristic features is expected to improve the estimation accuracy. However, as DNNs generally require large volumes of data for training, it is difficult to apply them to estimation problems for which large training datasets are unavailable. In this paper, we use two strategies to overcome the problem of insufficient training data: the use of a pretrained DNN model and the use of pretext tasks for learning the feature representation. We extract features using the resulting DNNs and estimate the tiller numbers through a regression technique. We conducted experiments using side-view whole plant images taken with plan backgroud. The experimental results show that the proposed methods using a pretrained model and specific pretext tasks achieve better performance than the conventional method.",36714728,10.3389/fpls.2022.1016507,pubmed,Journal Article,deep neural network (DNN); pretext task; regression; self-supervised learning; tiller number estimation,No MeSH terms,"['36714728', '34004493', '27079534', '36238674', '34609080', '35898050', '38149628', '32359271', '35587618', '28946991', '34717189', '27490187', '36270199', '38129376', '31980101', '38017202', '33328946', '31021783', '33007112', '34342586', '35201993', '38297920', '34915425', '35942446', '34314354', '34818638', '32726770', '35052161', '36277673', '34618054', '30986724', '32406847', '32889406', '34630062', '32635619', '29278490', '26606168', '28254085', '29062291', '37223131', '31856829', '35890847', '30747910', '36673172', '32822293', '31868927', '31591638', '32729840', '29668310', '33429131', '36850884', '33413181', '26930680', '36568699', '37465369', '35208392', '30320286', '35039620', '35814554', '35240379', '32155834', '35137305', '34852589', '36131030', '35200740', '35455214', '35730288', '37241531', '35776094', '32438582', '33545610', '34986031', '29857712', '26540673', '30712600', '33799219', '35881601', '34995315', '28861708', '25439765', '36624136', '37748394', '30412635', '30603189', '31499353', '35794723', '36015969', '36439414', '32386141', '34520508', '33577454', '28082889', '33459255', '32197380', '30804783', '30615828', '32896633', '32243154', '33808207', '37926734', '37391115', '31976925', '27493624', '38373137', '37066215', '36945326', '36713602', '37030870', '38051629', '37262111', '33313553', '37973801', '37475267', '35576413', '38054333', '38054288', '36818295', '36173779', '36197864', '35259096', '37205975', '37409048', '37606357', '36155469', '38138384', '38054298', '37859729', '36322501', '35259117', '37261332', '36955919', '36714728', '34004493', '27079534', '34609080', '35814554', '35455214', '36714728', '34004493', '27079534', '36238674', '34609080', '35898050', '34282452', '33898978', '31702012', '30040630', '29930694', '29375647', '28736569', '26424785', '26099924', '36714728', '35814554', '35455214', '28861708', '37027763', '36714728', '35814554', '35455214', '28861708', '37027763']"

Sensor-Driven Human-Robot Synergy: A Systems Engineering Approach.,"Tsolakis, Naoum; Gasteratos, Antonios",2022-12-20,"Knowledge-based synergistic automation is a potential intermediate option between the opposite extremes of manual and fully automated robotic labor in agriculture. Disruptive information and communication technologies (ICT) and sophisticated solutions for human-robot interaction (HRI) endow a skilled farmer with enhanced capabilities to perform agricultural tasks more efficiently and productively. This research aspires to apply systems engineering principles to assess the design of a conceptual human-robot synergistic platform enabled by a sensor-driven ICT sub-system. In particular, this paper firstly presents an overview of a use case, including a human-robot synergistic platform comprising a drone, a mobile platform, and wearable equipment. The technology framework constitutes a paradigm of human-centric worker-robot logistics synergy for high-value crops, which is applicable in operational environments of outdoor in-field harvesting and handling operations. Except for the physical sub-system, the ICT sub-system of the robotic framework consists of an extended sensor network for enabling data acquisition to extract the context (e.g., worker's status, environment awareness) and plan and schedule the robotic agents of the framework. Secondly, this research explicitly presents the underpinning Design Structure Matrix (DSM) that systematically captures the interrelations between the sensors in the platform and data/information signals for enabling synergistic operations. The employed Systems Engineering approach provides a comprehensible analysis of the baseline structure existing in the examined human-robot synergy platform. In particular, the applied DSM allows for understanding and synthesizing a sensor sub-system's architecture and enriching its efficacy by informing targeted interventions and reconfiguring the developed robotic solution modules depending on the required farming tasks at an orchard. Human-centric solutions for the agrarian sector demand careful study of the features that the particular agri-field possesses; thus, the insight DSM provides to system designers can turn out to be useful in the investigation of other similar data-driven applications.",36616620,10.3390/s23010021,pubmed,Journal Article,data and information flows; decision structure matrix; human-centric agriculture; human–robot collaboration; human–robot synergy; systems engineering,Humans; Robotics; Engineering; Agriculture; Knowledge Bases; Farms,"['36616620', '37571559', '34345198', '36721646', '24750989', '34013965', '35336455', '36952438', '35161819', '32850104', '36433495', '28411734', '38139627', '31751257', '11539291', '27517934', '24416094', '33668162', '37837147', '35746222', '24787636', '35459028', '34010136', '26042329', '33198160', '33137977', '17036812', '33937343', '33816860', '22969401', '35572379', '35957377', '36554320', '36646253', '27098262', '34300366', '33612525', '15575718', '36457737', '20163735', '34203831', '35336584', '31616275', '34960355', '26042327', '34721730', '35845254', '36404913', '38257670', '32349247', '30856032', '37529321', '20033506', '36236716', '22163729', '36905077', '36016060', '31426899', '38130401', '36097703', '32182906', '34192136', '32512903', '28587252', '22275681', '37718066', '37514710', '35677082', '34826350', '2671006', '36236261', '35458808', '34203766', '34695880', '34136534', '33808626', '23582470', '34568434', '32746376', '38023451', '38293071', '33228034', '22294927', '35062459', '36433341', '38101573', '23654257', '37420924', '32141423', '30487414', '25143976', '35898084', '26042328', '36313251', '38350296', '32937939', '26151202', '33808860', '20801611', '35214265', '33202674', '28813919', '36616973', '35155587', '32404174', '34884147', '31952178', '22042583', '34770429', '37287473', '36366086', '33501184', '34202746', '29963916', '36329473', '34026858', '37765791', '37645308', '37852080', '37180389', '37876910', '38168145', '37836855', '36616647', '38250751', '37228356', '36881919', '30416935', '37571746', '37266512', '38305303', '37688044', '22347165', '36732404', '35056193', '38106544', '36787453', '31284410', '38263961', '23299624', '36679645', '37454142', '37522044', '37766019', '36991669', '38002120', '36792733', '38211568', '38351114', '38020438', '37661941', '37631794', '36224362', '36687202', '36616620', '34345198', '36721646', '24750989', '34013965', '33668162', '36616620', '37571559', '34345198', '36721646', '24750989', '34013965', '35214470', '34460688', '34072975', '33121194', '32906851', '31416131', '36616620', '36721646', '33668162', '35746222', '26042329', '33198160', '36554320', '27098262', '34300366', '26042327', '36404913', '30856032', '2671006', '36236261', '23582470', '34568434', '35062459', '32141423', '26042328', '20801611', '34770429', '36329473', '36616620', '36721646', '33668162', '35746222', '26042329', '33198160']"
Radiomics-Based Detection of COVID-19 from Chest X-ray Using Interpretable Soft Label-Driven TSK Fuzzy Classifier.,"Zhang, Yuanpeng; Yang, Dongrong; Lam, Saikit; Li, Bing; Teng, Xinzhi; Zhang, Jiang; Zhou, Ta; Ma, Zongrui; Ying, Tin-Cheung Michael; Cai, Jing",2022-10-27,"The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a significant global public health threat with an escalating number of new cases and death toll daily. The early detection of COVID-related CXR abnormality potentially allows the early isolation of suspected cases. Chest X-Ray (CXR) is a fast and highly accessible imaging modality. Recently, a number of CXR-based AI models have been developed for the automated detection of COVID-19. However, most existing models are difficult to interpret due to the use of incomprehensible deep features in their models. Confronted with this, we developed an interpretable TSK fuzzy system in this study for COVID-19 detection using radiomics features extracted from CXR images. There are two main contributions. (1) When TSK fuzzy systems are applied to classification tasks, the commonly used binary label matrix of training samples is transformed into a soft one in order to learn a more discriminant transformation matrix and hence improve classification accuracy. (2) Based on the assumption that the samples in the same class should be kept as close as possible when they are transformed into the label space, the compactness class graph is introduced to avoid overfitting caused by label matrix relaxation. Our proposed model for a multi-categorical classification task (COVID-19 vs. No-Findings vs. Pneumonia) was evaluated using 600 CXR images from publicly available datasets and compared against five state-of-the-art AI models in aspects of classification accuracy. Experimental findings showed that our model achieved classification accuracy of over 83%, which is better than the state-of-the-art models, while maintaining high interpretability.",36359456,10.3390/diagnostics12112613,pubmed,Journal Article,COVID-19; TSK fuzzy systems; class compactness graph; radiomics; soft label,No MeSH terms,"['36359456', '33425044', '35634810', '35079203', '32946410', '34300266', '35683400', '28325604', '34229144', '35263458', '37022881', '33997112', '34764554', '33688379', '33529154', '37233906', '34395185', '34795794', '34248292', '34975264', '32550254', '35064446', '33420641', '32568675', '35360503', '35213339', '37285251', '35035591', '33817008', '32511510', '34903956', '34842222', '36362864', '32773400', '35328271', '32868966', '35581272', '35204418', '33029064', '35938148', '33612539', '32971995', '35935665', '33857181', '34764590', '34630030', '28166507', '34164119', '33972584', '34194484', '36298328', '33866253', '33560995', '38199069', '35822170', '32836918', '33013005', '34219966', '36621192', '37009465', '37418397', '38332344', '38280037', '36359456', '33425044', '35634810', '35079203', '32946410', '35822170', '36359456', '33425044', '35634810', '35079203', '32946410', '34300266', '35431611', '33994847', '33705321', '33629156', '33527000', '33519321', '33177550', '33169119', '33169050', '32837749', '32781377', '32599338', '32568675', '32524445', '32216962', '32159775', '32105562', '31663612', '28880184', '28166507', '24808561', '24710838', '21693417', '36359456', '35822170', '36359456', '35822170']"
A biomedical knowledge graph-based method for drug-drug interactions prediction through combining local and global features with deep neural networks.,"Ren, Zhong-Hao; You, Zhu-Hong; Yu, Chang-Qing; Li, Li-Ping; Guan, Yong-Jian; Guo, Lu-Xiang; Pan, Jie",No date,"Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) prediction is a challenging task in drug development and clinical application. Due to the extremely large complete set of all possible DDIs, computer-aided DDIs prediction methods are getting lots of attention in the pharmaceutical industry and academia. However, most existing computational methods only use single perspective information and few of them conduct the task based on the biomedical knowledge graph (BKG), which can provide more detailed and comprehensive drug lateral side information flow. To this end, a deep learning framework, namely DeepLGF, is proposed to fully exploit BKG fusing local-global information to improve the performance of DDIs prediction. More specifically, DeepLGF first obtains chemical local information on drug sequence semantics through a natural language processing algorithm. Then a model of BFGNN based on graph neural network is proposed to extract biological local information on drug through learning embedding vector from different biological functional spaces. The global feature information is extracted from the BKG by our knowledge graph embedding method. In DeepLGF, for fusing local-global features well, we designed four aggregating methods to explore the most suitable ones. Finally, the advanced fusing feature vectors are fed into deep neural network to train and predict. To evaluate the prediction performance of DeepLGF, we tested our method in three prediction tasks and compared it with state-of-the-art models. In addition, case studies of three cancer-related and COVID-19-related drugs further demonstrated DeepLGF's superior ability for potential DDIs prediction.

End-to-End Retinex-Based Illumination Attention Low-Light Enhancement Network for Autonomous Driving at Night.,"Zhao, Ruini; Han, Yi; Zhao, Jian",2022-08-20,"Low-light image enhancement is a preprocessing work for many recognition and tracking tasks for autonomous driving at night. It needs to handle various factors simultaneously including uneven lighting, low contrast, and artifacts. We propose a novel end-to-end Retinex-based illumination attention low-light enhancement network. Specifically, our proposed method adopts multibranch architecture to extract rich features for different depth levels. Meanwhile, we consider the features from different scales in built-in illumination attention module. We encode reflectance features and illumination features into latent space based on Retinex in each submodule, which could cater for highly ill-posed image decomposition tasks. It aims to enhance the desired illumination features under different receptive fields. Subsequently, we propose a memory gate mechanism to learn adaptively long-term and short-term memory. Their weight could control how many high-level and low-level features should be reserved. This method could improve the image quality from both different feature scales and feature levels. Comprehensive experiments on BDD10K and cityscapes datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms various types of methods in terms of visual quality and quantitative metrics. We also show that our proposed method has certain antinoise capability and generalizes well without fine-tuning when dealing with unseen images. Meanwhile, our restoration performance is comparable to that of advanced computationally intensive models.1.",36039345,10.1155/2022/4942420,pubmed,Journal Article,No keywords,"Algorithms; Attention; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Lighting; Pattern Recognition, Automated","['36039345', '35891145', '23669986', '15641720', '24846606', '36679592', '20923738', '16826262', '36607085', '21712161', '35585731', '37953346', '15717550', '20052099', '37896535', '18703831', '33104544', '20172829', '38081896', '22562762', '25906370', '33930072', '36015886', '16526422', '38306351', '18000331', '24951698', '25216483', '20634558', '17283775', '29570085', '17627050', '36155657', '27992431', '20624709', '35839183', '25751866', '22585101', '18579929', '33249342', '21503057', '22067364', '36225037', '37558723', '20855278', '23380843', '23807447', '23725638', '26221707', '23849699', '24108464', '19299862', '16602604', '18432471', '24051862', '25333098', '36730132', '17926699', '19762925', '17356200', '35898096', '23846471', '28391812', '19110498', '36577141', '20421666', '19021445', '23038545', '28279861', '25607153', '33460379', '16396034', '25775493', '35947571', '16929737', '37157585', '22481826', '24951700', '19147870', '24922441', '32167892', '18232383', '16948316', '37279121', '16900685', '17108386', '23037414', '24505707', '17496373', '16886864', '32872196', '15751847', '28600236', '35308314', '25426639', '36520703', '17431307', '34661856', '23492378', '33513902', '32286975', '15875791', '26560928', '36258356', '18542256', '22180510', '17627048', '18270103', '18270089', '22418553', '19065180', '21693423', '22179895', '16579379', '17022264', '19884092', '37706788', '36917373', '37628231', '33989152', '36821201', '37644042', '36365942', '36146148', '36610260', '38261483', '37688058', '37989041', '38178397', '37410642', '33929967', '36904700', '36146252', '37018279', '36417743', '35853059', '36607035', '36215366', '38358860', '36039345', '35891145', '23669986', '15641720', '24846606', '36679592', '36039345', '35891145', '23669986', '15641720', '24846606', '36679592', '33481709', '32960763', '31052585', '30998467', '28113318', '25609045', '24108715', '22641706', '21609884', '21292594', '18282987', '18282940', '36039345', '36039345']"
An efficient modular framework for automatic LIONC classification of MedIMG using unified medical language.,"Bhatia, Surbhi; Alojail, Mohammed; Sengan, Sudhakar; Dadheech, Pankaj",2022-08-10,"Handwritten prescriptions and radiological reports: doctors use handwritten prescriptions and radiological reports to give drugs to patients who have illnesses, injuries, or other problems. Clinical text data, like physician prescription visuals and radiology reports, should be labelled with specific information such as disease type, features, and anatomical location for more effective use. The semantic annotation of vast collections of biological and biomedical texts, like scientific papers, medical reports, and general practitioner observations, has lately been examined by doctors and scientists. By identifying and disambiguating references to biomedical concepts in texts, medical semantics annotators could generate such annotations automatically. For Medical Images (MedIMG), we provide a methodology for learning an effective holistic representation (handwritten word pictures as well as radiology reports). Deep Learning (DL) methods have recently gained much interest for their capacity to achieve expert-level accuracy in automated MedIMG analysis. We discovered that tasks requiring significant responsive fields are ideal for downscaled input images that are qualitatively verified by examining functional, responsive areas and class activating maps for training models. This article focuses on the following contributions: (a) Information Extraction from Narrative MedImages, (b) Automatic categorisation on image resolution with an impact on MedIMG, and (c) Hybrid Model to Predictions of Named Entity Recognition utilising RNN + LSTM + GRM that perform admirably in every trainee for every input purpose. At the same time, supplying understandable scale weight implies that such multi-scale structures are also crucial for extracting information from high-resolution MedIMG. A portion of the reports (30%) are manually evaluated by trained physicians, while the rest were automatically categorised using deep supervised training models based on attention mechanisms and supplied with test reports. MetaMapLite proved recall and precision, but also an F1-score equivalent for primary biomedicine text search techniques and medical text examination on many databases of MedIMG. In addition to implementing as well as getting the requirements for MedIMG, the article explores the quality of medical data by using DL techniques for reaching large-scale labelled clinical data and also the significance of their real-time efforts in the biomedical study that have played an instrumental role in its extramural diffusion and global appeal.",36033768,10.3389/fpubh.2022.926229,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",LIONC; MedIMG; accuracy; deep learning; natural language processing,"Databases, Factual; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Language; Natural Language Processing; Semantics","['36033768', '26481140', '28552401', '30217670', '26890880', '36759679', '30699011', '28938912', '22195225', '29935347', '29329701', '33936418', '32574362', '24393765', '25948699', '18625612', '19965054', '26423616', '31838210', '34390853', '28050714', '31150777', '23850839', '36384464', '22865274', '14759819', '27444186', '28451691', '21752612', '31569654', '36788196', '31501885', '34789238', '33433395', '32410573', '26002820', '32702106', '27338146', '19900574', '29980203', '30048461', '37625508', '35321705', '36905469', '30815153', '35974113', '35561439', '37930897', '32112285', '32562898', '11079848', '28699566', '31627032', '33367705', '22195220', '35007754', '20351945', '19135551', '31980104', '28140627', '21094696', '16119261', '16160361', '19447070', '18426548', '22085698', '7719797', '32244833', '30961622', '31801540', '18547432', '27312781', '29981490', '27089187', '33885370', '37852347', '25510606', '31437897', '35451969', '33569716', '34135950', '35907966', '31021325', '28130331', '33059690', '29381109', '31710668', '33010425', '34383671', '33383527', '17224611', '31546016', '27406024', '26187250', '19393341', '28257498', '36527782', '37838290', '32425358', '36542426', '36253581', '35960900', '36637893', '36083212', '36701968', '37547812', '38101689', '37316100', '36990288', '37126041', '33781918', '34922517', '37290540', '37203497', '37837742', '33130435', '37388252', '34839119', '36526439', '37652343', '37203500', '30815145', '37952385', '37952206', '34990212', '37081610', '38098169', '31805934', '36855134', '35146510', '37172153', '37149274', '35980110', '36772095', '38329788', '37551911', '35978441', '36865077', '37430103', '30840055', '38028616', '37571481', '37673573', '38132500', '38318751', '38327668', '37507376', '30864314', '35854739', '38359660', '37682321', '38035197', '38308070', '38269660', '37393610', '32504536', '38269886', '37225853', '35975112', '28815118', '37693398', '37384616', '35463193', '28815135', '36404800', '36748005', '36033768', '26481140', '28552401', '30217670', '28938912', '27089187', '36033768', '26481140', '28552401', '30217670', '26890880', '36759679', '35372222', '34339369', '32956047', '32746142', '32609615', '32365937', '31947234', '26000792', '15628266', '36033768', '28938912', '27089187', '37172153', '36033768', '28938912', '27089187', '37172153']"
MKGE: Knowledge graph embedding with molecular structure information.,"Zhang, Yi; Li, Zhouhan; Duan, Biao; Qin, Lei; Peng, Jing",2022-07-14,"To easier manipulate Knowledge Graphs (KGs), knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is proposed and wildly used. However, the relations between entities are usually incomplete due to the performance problems of knowledge extraction methods, which also leads to the sparsity of KGs and make it difficult for KGE methods to obtain reliable representations. Related research has not paid much attention to this challenge in the biomedicine field and has not sufficiently integrated the domain knowledge into KGE methods. To alleviate this problem, we try to incorporate the molecular structure information of the entity into KGE. Specifically, we adopt two strategies to obtain the vector representations of the entities: text-structure-based and graph-structure-based. Then, we spliced the two together as the input of the KGE models. To validate our model, we construct a KCCR knowledge graph and validate the model's superiority in entity prediction, relation prediction, and drug-drug interaction prediction tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that molecular structure information has been integrated into KGE methods. It is worth noting that researchers can try to improve the work based on KGE by fusing other feature annotations such as Gene Ontology and protein structure.",35945150,10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2022.107730,pubmed,Journal Article,Drug-drug interaction prediction; Knowledge graph embedding; Link prediction; Molecular representation learning,"Gene Ontology; Knowledge; Molecular Structure; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Semantics","['35945150', '37322903', '33706227', '31698640', '34844576', '38043469', '37524764', '38114937', '38348746', '33341877', '34603428', '35880623', '35855405', '37323853', '34490421', '36203718', '37778673', '36893693', '38066573', '32065227', '37339154', '37895593', '38040858', '36053574', '33286937', '34115594', '37679131', '35324433', '37190485', '32143785', '31238875', '34901843', '34710122', '36918766', '35150235', '36070624', '35801474', '35687647', '33606639', '34811351', '34992642', '33784319', '37481946', '34157650', '36933632', '33317512', '35909848', '29949999', '36896554', '34694230', '36271850', '34649044', '33817007', '38222382', '35602643', '34847734', '35840060', '35049514', '35901452', '35809972', '36780860', '37018088', '36450187', '35246025', '37868056', '36014371', '34045950', '35453147', '36018871', '33449889', '31295118', '35769283', '33816992', '36180861', '31900127', '35214446', '33989299', '34375284', '31194807', '37391722', '37190445', '32436854', '34669575', '36384050', '38309139', '35655307', '35181524', '36151740', '37128437', '37089903', '33323115', '33833858', '35226606', '37015419', '33126246', '21788187', '35193692', '36528805', '32783631', '34653224', '38367354', '37335781', '33334307', '34185011', '34944427', '33285426', '33719344', '33181823', '33310193', '32232320', '33743320', '35641162', '32853152', '35161730', '36509800', '31798437', '33541342', '35658098', '34471921', '23566040', '31368482', '37100502', '35176135', '35975455', '33317504', '37532000', '31874639', '36091997', '35536818', '35756147', '34119691', '37644440', '37389415', '37322032', '37759342', '36125173', '38295121', '37145951', '36777631', '38319781', '35965491', '38276570', '36067109', '36318240', '37934748', '37457837', '37847632', '34788369', '35786563', '37128597', '34437066', '35304504', '37879936', '36643405', '37571587', '37322041', '36085310', '37901497', '37925767', '35872411', '37274445', '37250202', '36147662', '37235186', '34735335', '37475158', '36934569', '38066573', '35945150', '33706227', '31698640', '34844576', '33341877', '32065227', '35945150', '37322903', '33706227', '31698640', '34844576', '38043469', '35945150', '34844576', '32065227', '34649044', '36151740', '36125173', '36147662', '35945150', '34844576', '32065227', '34649044', '36151740', '36125173']"

Temporal dynamics of requirements engineering from mobile app reviews.,"Alves de Lima, Vitor Mesaque; de Araújo, Adailton Ferreira; Marcondes Marcacini, Ricardo",2022-03-15,"Opinion mining for app reviews aims to analyze people's comments from app stores to support data-driven requirements engineering activities, such as bug report classification, new feature requests, and usage experience. However, due to a large amount of textual data, manually analyzing these comments is challenging, and machine-learning-based methods have been used to automate opinion mining. Although recent methods have obtained promising results for extracting and categorizing requirements from users' opinions, the main focus of existing studies is to help software engineers to explore historical user behavior regarding software requirements. Thus, existing models are used to support corrective maintenance from app reviews, while we argue that this valuable user knowledge can be used for preventive software maintenance. This paper introduces the temporal dynamics of requirements analysis to answer the following question: how to predict initial trends on defective requirements from users' opinions before negatively impacting the overall app's evaluation? We present the MAPP-Reviews (Monitoring App Reviews) method, which (i) extracts requirements with negative evaluation from app reviews, (ii) generates time series based on the frequency of negative evaluation, and (iii) trains predictive models to identify requirements with higher trends of negative evaluation. The experimental results from approximately 85,000 reviews show that opinions extracted from user reviews provide information about the future behavior of an app requirement, thereby allowing software engineers to anticipate the identification of requirements that may affect the future app's ratings.",35494867,10.7717/peerj-cs.874,pubmed,Journal Article,App reviews; Emerging issue; Opinion mining; Requirement engineering; Requirement extraction; Temporal dynamics,No MeSH terms,"['35494867', '38196956', '35774947', '33287075', '33885375', '34709186', '35275069', '34624662', '36674345', '28389420', '25972309', '32348293', '37362743', '34528886', '34855619', '29907557', '27220371', '35023843', '25119490', '32663158', '32041437', '29944708', '30690286', '31617851', '34951863', '33847596', '30869639', '34076579', '35309594', '30153925', '31913128', '34904955', '35249886', '36969371', '34460922', '33646128', '30745188', '35060912', '34468323', '33263552', '31304313', '30843864', '34787579', '27919275', '30547081', '25962135', '34914718', '34710991', '31162132', '34821567', '32525491', '34569466', '35100129', '30573443', '34281994', '31473444', '27637405', '33289670', '31373286', '24459430', '34734826', '28408361', '33596181', '29875087', '31418428', '29025694', '31383477', '28701291', '34878998', '32687480', '34794117', '35321018', '29770246', '30702435', '32012095', '33258793', '28768606', '34636741', '24470587', '35137684', '34017609', '26543913', '31126843', '32040386', '32882808', '31920160', '37668599', '38259895', '35669568', '37705619', '35494867', '35774947', '33287075', '33885375', '34709186', '31383477', '35494867', '38196956', '35774947', '33287075', '33885375', '34709186', '35494867', '31383477', '35494867', '31383477']"
IL-MCAM: An interactive learning and multi-channel attention mechanism-based weakly supervised colorectal histopathology image classification approach.,"Chen, Haoyuan; Li, Chen; Li, Xiaoyan; Rahaman, Md Mamunur; Hu, Weiming; Li, Yixin; Liu, Wanli; Sun, Changhao; Sun, Hongzan; Huang, Xinyu; Grzegorzek, Marcin",2022-01-31,"In recent years, colorectal cancer has become one of the most significant diseases that endanger human health. Deep learning methods are increasingly important for the classification of colorectal histopathology images. However, existing approaches focus more on end-to-end automatic classification using computers rather than human-computer interaction. In this paper, we propose an IL-MCAM framework. It is based on attention mechanisms and interactive learning. The proposed IL-MCAM framework includes two stages: automatic learning (AL) and interactivity learning (IL). In the AL stage, a multi-channel attention mechanism model containing three different attention mechanism channels and convolutional neural networks is used to extract multi-channel features for classification. In the IL stage, the proposed IL-MCAM framework continuously adds misclassified images to the training set in an interactive approach, which improves the classification ability of the MCAM model. We carried out a comparison experiment on our dataset and an extended experiment on the HE-NCT-CRC-100K dataset to verify the performance of the proposed IL-MCAM framework, achieving classification accuracies of 98.98% and 99.77%, respectively. In addition, we conducted an ablation experiment and an interchangeability experiment to verify the ability and interchangeability of the three channels. The experimental results show that the proposed IL-MCAM framework has excellent performance in the colorectal histopathological image classification tasks.",35123138,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2022.105265,pubmed,Journal Article,Attention mechanism; Colorectal cancer histopathology image; Image classification; Interactivity learning,No MeSH terms,"['35123138', '35671654', '34303169', '34053009', '34794136', '28549410', '37011426', '36328667', '34181583', '35872410', '34892046', '32445109', '36804696', '36191350', '35588568', '36577142', '35952419', '35986967', '36298117', '35081497', '33688390', '28254085', '28676295', '37295389', '33497891', '31588387', '31416555', '34375901', '33809611', '37567046', '36933385', '35880375', '30222548', '33646948', '37258631', '36682215', '31484154', '37467642', '37028019', '36864700', '30838023', '30298088', '29990156', '36871547', '34645863', '28861708', '37271050', '36809427', '36717788', '34627021', '36088891', '30603216', '36552061', '34138403', '29756129', '35306442', '32293303', '33018216', '35744561', '32653985', '37294411', '29060786', '35016101', '31315618', '33523807', '31425939', '24637156', '33677262', '31586788', '36515554', '35322430', '26826901', '33964886', '35957336', '34548886', '34461503', '35671603', '35509058', '34986432', '35688048', '33378900', '34412836', '34898432', '35780594', '30103029', '34890992', '28692971', '26887016', '36209623', '30524056', '30624207', '35536056', '35571059', '37978549', '37746052', '37304838', '37258631', '37144160', '37050506', '37005441', '36891388', '36824470', '36819026', '36760405', '36554170', '36387248', '36068309', '35663041', '35123138', '35671654', '34303169', '34053009', '34375901', '28861708', '35123138', '35671654', '34303169', '34053009', '34794136', '28549410', '35123138', '34375901', '28861708', '35123138', '34375901', '28861708']"
A Computer-Aided Diagnosis System Using Deep Learning for Multiclass Skin Lesion Classification.,"Arshad, Mehak; Khan, Muhammad Attique; Tariq, Usman; Armghan, Ammar; Alenezi, Fayadh; Younus Javed, Muhammad; Aslam, Shabnam Mohamed; Kadry, Seifedine",2021-12-06,"In the USA, each year, almost 5.4 million people are diagnosed with skin cancer. Melanoma is one of the most dangerous types of skin cancer, and its survival rate is 5%. The development of skin cancer has risen over the last couple of years. Early identification of skin cancer can help reduce the human mortality rate. Dermoscopy is a technology used for the acquisition of skin images. However, the manual inspection process consumes more time and required much cost. The recent development in the area of deep learning showed significant performance for classification tasks. In this research work, a new automated framework is proposed for multiclass skin lesion classification. The proposed framework consists of a series of steps. In the first step, augmentation is performed. For the augmentation process, three operations are performed: rotate 90, right-left flip, and up and down flip. In the second step, deep models are fine-tuned. Two models are opted, such as ResNet-50 and ResNet-101, and updated their layers. In the third step, transfer learning is applied to train both fine-tuned deep models on augmented datasets. In the succeeding stage, features are extracted and performed fusion using a modified serial-based approach. Finally, the fused vector is further enhanced by selecting the best features using the skewness-controlled SVR approach. The final selected features are classified using several machine learning algorithms and selected based on the accuracy value. In the experimental process, the augmented HAM10000 dataset is used and achieved an accuracy of 91.7%. Moreover, the performance of the augmented dataset is better as compared to the original imbalanced dataset.

JAMIP: an artificial-intelligence aided data-driven infrastructure for computational materials informatics.,"Zhao, Xin-Gang; Zhou, Kun; Xing, Bangyu; Zhao, Ruoting; Luo, Shulin; Li, Tianshu; Sun, Yuanhui; Na, Guangren; Xie, Jiahao; Yang, Xiaoyu; Wang, Xinjiang; Wang, Xiaoyu; He, Xin; Lv, Jian; Fu, Yuhao; Zhang, Lijun",2021-06-15,"Materials informatics has emerged as a promisingly new paradigm for accelerating materials discovery and design. It exploits the intelligent power of machine learning methods in massive materials data from experiments or simulations to seek new materials, functionality, and principles, etc. Developing specialized facilities to generate, collect, manage, learn, and mine large-scale materials data is crucial to materials informatics. We herein developed an artificial-intelligence-aided data-driven infrastructure named Jilin Artificial-intelligence aided Materials-design Integrated Package (JAMIP), which is an open-source Python framework to meet the research requirements of computational materials informatics. It is integrated by materials production factory, high-throughput first-principles calculations engine, automatic tasks submission and monitoring progress, data extraction, management and storage system, and artificial intelligence machine learning based data mining functions. We have integrated specific features such as an inorganic crystal structure prototype database to facilitate high-throughput calculations and essential modules associated with machine learning studies of functional materials. We demonstrated how our developed code is useful in exploring materials informatics of optoelectronic semiconductors by taking halide perovskites as typical case. By obeying the principles of automation, extensibility, reliability, and intelligence, the JAMIP code is a promisingly powerful tool contributing to the fast-growing field of computational materials informatics.",36654167,10.1016/j.scib.2021.06.011,pubmed,Journal Article,Computational material; Data-driven; First-principles calculation; High-throughput calculation; Materials informatics,Artificial Intelligence; Reproducibility of Results; Informatics; Machine Learning; Intelligence,"['36654167', '36805192', '35861448', '28055930', '35786336', '37955165', '37232359', '32519718', '32143073', '37687620', '26992173', '36629787', '35759465', '33751044', '32096410', '37622898', '34725693', '34821909', '34731478', '37917731', '34438223', '35593754', '35236085', '30550043', '34517539', '28881183', '36031967', '34342493', '34914045', '30465503', '35320698', '38089452', '33944788', '36972592', '30710543', '33982820', '34159484', '34880124', '34812823', '34202291', '34833853', '35230849', '35341542', '19349246', '35112474', '36468206', '36305614', '31651216', '30054833', '31661083', '36016060', '35283223', '36085353', '37813548', '31351213', '35150379', '36960275', '34282519', '21452981', '35190537', '33575021', '29974498', '37355214', '32996368', '26017444', '32309594', '34343059', '19342352', '32318789', '31845543', '27491648', '34686947', '31518513', '36008002', '33944533', '32205581', '31958928', '35996023', '34057379', '36069404', '35632184', '32602844', '32537842', '35962355', '35074790', '33528245', '34696089', '36270953', '31419812', '35408094', '34412024', '36462761', '36725681', '35347425', '35142086', '33978793', '31601480', '18291542', '34617632', '32236811', '34906321', '36362355', '37688451', '34523399', '37522135', '37361859', '31728276', '37441239', '29234465', '38279508', '38177590', '38167836', '36723221', '37454690', '37962619', '38127401', '37259400', '34640157', '37357977', '36251351', '38177883', '37312681', '34713208', '38287889', '38030721', '37298813', '34122942', '37228361', '37637738', '38035192', '38050899', '36817352', '38249985', '38217168', '38213008', '37875458', '36909937', '37767941', '37928368', '37172318', '38322109', '38333623', '37491475', '37311557', '35296116', '34557898', '37547493', '37746699', '38217287', '37833266', '37687675', '36787368', '36654167', '33844136', '36805192', '35861448', '28055930', '35786336', '36654167', '36805192', '35861448', '28055930', '35786336', '37955165', '36654167', '33844136', '36805192', '35861448', '28055930', '35786336', '32519718', '36629787', '35759465', '33751044', '34821909', '34731478', '34438223', '35236085', '30550043', '28881183', '30465503', '35320698', '33944788', '30710543', '33982820', '36624355', '34812823', '34202291', '34833853', '35341542', '35112474', '36578657', '36468206', '30054833', '35283223', '31351213', '35150379', '36960275', '21452981', '33575021', '29974498', '32996368', '26017444', '32309594', '32318789', '31845543', '27491648', '34686947', '31518513', '32205581', '35996023', '36069404', '32602844', '32537842', '36270953', '35408094', '34412024', '36462761', '36725681', '35347425', '33978793', '33295676', '33060388', '31601480', '18291542', '34617632', '34906321', '36362355', '36723221', '37259400', '36251351', '36896758', '37172318', '36654167', '33844136', '36805192', '35861448', '28055930', '35786336']"
Inferring entire spiking activity from local field potentials.,"Ahmadi, Nur; Constandinou, Timothy G; Bouganis, Christos-Savvas",2021-09-24,"Extracellular recordings are typically analysed by separating them into two distinct signals: local field potentials (LFPs) and spikes. Previous studies have shown that spikes, in the form of single-unit activity (SUA) or multiunit activity (MUA), can be inferred solely from LFPs with moderately good accuracy. SUA and MUA are typically extracted via threshold-based technique which may not be reliable when the recordings exhibit a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Another type of spiking activity, referred to as entire spiking activity (ESA), can be extracted by a threshold-less, fast, and automated technique and has led to better performance in several tasks. However, its relationship with the LFPs has not been investigated. In this study, we aim to address this issue by inferring ESA from LFPs intracortically recorded from the motor cortex area of three monkeys performing different tasks. Results from long-term recording sessions and across subjects revealed that ESA can be inferred from LFPs with good accuracy. On average, the inference performance of ESA was consistently and significantly higher than those of SUA and MUA. In addition, local motor potential (LMP) was found to be the most predictive feature. The overall results indicate that LFPs contain substantial information about spiking activity, particularly ESA. This could be useful for understanding LFP-spike relationship and for the development of LFP-based BMIs.",34561480,10.1038/s41598-021-98021-9,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,"Action Potentials; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Datasets as Topic; Electrophysiology; Macaca mulatta; Male; Motor Cortex; Signal-To-Noise Ratio; Task Performance and Analysis","['34561480', '21273313', '24809544', '22157115', '24921388', '25946198', '23744624', '30809117', '22733013', '35921802', '14634657', '31242046', '23981719', '18160425', '28100654', '21068271', '20702719', '26133797', '21307325', '24109685', '8985893', '20403782', '23543888', '37964432', '23366234', '21096002', '22496527', '22895722', '27511007', '23367398', '33018126', '26085629', '21048123', '18509031', '23918061', '8506287', '19889990', '22171043', '36086028', '25210154', '17376847', '33504797', '21508303', '24503623', '16738219', '23020111', '25754398', '18304489', '33242850', '16792288', '16310349', '19163917', '24035827', '22157112', '25571163', '25948867', '25570204', '18702717', '24388980', '33866366', '16192371', '29059844', '22586452', '17670985', '22490557', '33477128', '25570632', '23345227', '21958623', '30452979', '24990564', '9425187', '30050415', '21752998', '24109683', '21907800', '7714568', '24686295', '22031899', '31100751', '25416722', '26157365', '30780150', '16530860', '20943914', '16870724', '21096288', '25394574', '28966971', '35968845', '16424458', '17596418', '30540498', '29215034', '31947488', '21200434', '30523823', '20164405', '28113942', '36064880', '32746296', '37306412', '37758288', '37519930', '37169826', '35960767', '34561480', '21273313', '24809544', '22157115', '24921388', '28113942', '34561480', '21273313', '24809544', '22157115', '24921388', '25946198', '34561480', '28113942', '34561480', '28113942']"
An automated approach to identify scientific publications reporting pharmacokinetic parameters.,"Gonzalez Hernandez, Ferran; Carter, Simon J; Iso-Sipilä, Juha; Goldsmith, Paul; Almousa, Ahmed A; Gastine, Silke; Lilaonitkul, Watjana; Kloprogge, Frank; Standing, Joseph F",2021-04-21,"Pharmacokinetic (PK) predictions of new chemical entities are aided by prior knowledge from other compounds. The development of robust algorithms that improve preclinical and clinical phases of drug development remains constrained by the need to search, curate and standardise PK information across the constantly-growing scientific literature. The lack of centralised, up-to-date and comprehensive repositories of PK data represents a significant limitation in the drug development pipeline.In this work, we propose a machine learning approach to automatically identify and characterise scientific publications reporting PK parameters from in vivo data, providing a centralised repository of PK literature. A dataset of 4,792 PubMed publications was labelled by field experts depending on whether in vivo PK parameters were estimated in the study. Different classification pipelines were compared using a bootstrap approach and the best-performing architecture was used to develop a comprehensive and automatically-updated repository of PK publications. The best-performing architecture encoded documents using unigram features and mean pooling of BioBERT embeddings obtaining an F1 score of 83.8% on the test set. The pipeline retrieved over 121K PubMed publications in which in vivo PK parameters were estimated and it was scheduled to perform weekly updates on newly published articles.

DeriveNet for (Very) Low Resolution Image Classification.,"Singh, Maneet; Nagpal, Shruti; Singh, Richa; Vatsa, Mayank",2022-09-14,"Images captured from a distance often result in (very) low resolution (VLR/LR) region of interest, requiring automated identification. VLR/LR images (or regions of interest) often contain less information content, rendering ineffective feature extraction and classification. To this effect, this research proposes a novel DeriveNet model for VLR/LR classification, which focuses on learning effective class boundaries by utilizing the class-specific domain knowledge. DeriveNet model is jointly trained via two losses: (i) proposed Derived-Margin softmax loss and (ii) the proposed Reconstruction-Center (ReCent) loss. The Derived-Margin softmax loss focuses on learning an effective VLR classifier while explicitly modeling the inter-class variations. The ReCent loss incorporates domain information by learning a HR reconstruction space for approximating the class variations for the VLR/LR samples. It is utilized to derive inter-class margins for the Derived-Margin softmax loss. The DeriveNet model has been trained with a novel Multi-resolution Pyramid based data augmentation which enables the model to learn from varying resolutions during training. Experiments and analysis have been performed on multiple datasets for (i) VLR/LR face recognition, (ii) VLR digit classification, and (iii) VLR/LR face recognition from drone-shot videos. The DeriveNet model achieves state-of-the-art performance across different datasets, thus promoting its utility for several VLR/LR classification tasks.",34115585,10.1109/TPAMI.2021.3088756,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,"Algorithms; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated","['34115585', '21775262', '21062679', '22481822', '20129860', '35149416', '20876021', '17990759', '26571112', '20199936', '24051724', '24807954', '34347598', '16435554', '18617720', '20106738', '15971924', '21529372', '25320818', '23418451', '22067365', '31309585', '16903370', '32857706', '24579172', '17926705', '22898352', '15742888', '20421665', '25485379', '16900677', '16640259', '26405902', '18092595', '16566507', '18239714', '37774559', '26210914', '20603520', '19000969', '30583537', '18784029', '24956369', '19465863', '36502088', '19762923', '17063678', '21486712', '17926699', '19574164', '30183722', '18784044', '24723516', '26968846', '34110993', '17283779', '24048015', '18195434', '24951689', '16119271', '24835182', '31071019', '24474370', '15619939', '17431299', '25485381', '16685911', '15971928', '34474407', '24657351', '25453464', '24808205', '25122849', '32638187', '28316614', '35759597', '32679534', '26362074', '18482883', '17283765', '22203717', '24951700', '17699917', '26574298', '27046107', '20548107', '16370459', '24723517', '16830904', '17334437', '25769162', '22850462', '33800532', '20426183', '17354697', '33471753', '24051727', '26563686', '28759633', '24505680', '26352635', '19004710', '37145693', '35412972', '37238482', '33566759', '34106845', '38003205', '38252579', '35294343', '34106863', '34115585', '21775262', '21062679', '22481822', '20129860', '35149416', '34115585', '21775262', '21062679', '22481822', '20129860', '35149416', '34115585', '34115585']"
Toward an Automatic Quality Assessment of Voice-Based Telemedicine Consultations: A Deep Learning Approach.,"Habib, Maria; Faris, Mohammad; Qaddoura, Raneem; Alomari, Manal; Alomari, Alaa; Faris, Hossam",2021-05-10,"Maintaining a high quality of conversation between doctors and patients is essential in telehealth services, where efficient and competent communication is important to promote patient health. Assessing the quality of medical conversations is often handled based on a human auditory-perceptual evaluation. Typically, trained experts are needed for such tasks, as they follow systematic evaluation criteria. However, the daily rapid increase of consultations makes the evaluation process inefficient and impractical. This paper investigates the automation of the quality assessment process of patient-doctor voice-based conversations in a telehealth service using a deep-learning-based classification model. For this, the data consist of audio recordings obtained from Altibbi. Altibbi is a digital health platform that provides telemedicine and telehealth services in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). The objective is to assist Altibbi's operations team in the evaluation of the provided consultations in an automated manner. The proposed model is developed using three sets of features: features extracted from the signal level, the transcript level, and the signal and transcript levels. At the signal level, various statistical and spectral information is calculated to characterize the spectral envelope of the speech recordings. At the transcript level, a pre-trained embedding model is utilized to encompass the semantic and contextual features of the textual information.

The Role of Global Appearance of Omnidirectional Images in Relative Distance and Orientation Retrieval.,"Román, Vicente; Payá, Luis; Peidró, Adrián; Ballesta, Mónica; Reinoso, Oscar",2021-05-11,"Over the last few years, mobile robotics has experienced a great development thanks to the wide variety of problems that can be solved with this technology. An autonomous mobile robot must be able to operate in a priori unknown environments, planning its trajectory and navigating to the required target points. With this aim, it is crucial solving the mapping and localization problems with accuracy and acceptable computational cost. The use of omnidirectional vision systems has emerged as a robust choice thanks to the big quantity of information they can extract from the environment. The images must be processed to obtain relevant information that permits solving robustly the mapping and localization problems. The classical frameworks to address this problem are based on the extraction, description and tracking of local features or landmarks. However, more recently, a new family of methods has emerged as a robust alternative in mobile robotics. It consists of describing each image as a whole, what leads to conceptually simpler algorithms. While methods based on local features have been extensively studied and compared in the literature, those based on global appearance still merit a deep study to uncover their performance. In this work, a comparative evaluation of six global-appearance description techniques in localization tasks is carried out, both in terms of accuracy and computational cost. Some sets of images captured in a real environment are used with this aim, including some typical phenomena such as changes in lighting conditions, visual aliasing, partial occlusions and noise.",34064805,10.3390/s21103327,pubmed,Journal Article,fourier signature; gist; global appearance description; histogram of oriented gradients; image retrieval; localization; omnidirectional imaging; relative orientation,No MeSH terms,"['34064805', '28464032', '24534922', '26501289', '22163538', '34203682', '34770522', '37514780', '29949916', '28208766', '15628270', '26042327', '25265622', '26042328', '29522467', '30863434', '33806414', '29515386', '28934102', '17186813', '22287239', '30634639', '33419009', '32272635', '34068306', '31947183', '29186923', '19926897', '31623266', '33477398', '27690053', '37738191', '33918493', '27843754', '30285765', '27483264', '32041371', '15923736', '29544790', '33379292', '29372327', '16366247', '25856331', '27070607', '11605365', '27735857', '30154311', '31906166', '28033385', '31284648', '33069374', '32294135', '19336336', '18276332', '15890605', '26042330', '31323065', '28604624', '8991456', '16366241', '33494160', '29297768', '28459684', '28092594', '28786925', '26042329', '16240777', '16886864', '22047357', '28829387', '26368363', '32104171', '32470798', '8942055', '30621195', '31968620', '17926710', '33466401', '19828146', '25587560', '31498428', '26353283', '30065208', '37514780', '34064805', '28464032', '24534922', '26501289', '26042327', '26042328', '34064805', '28464032', '24534922', '26501289', '22163538', '34203682', '32878145', '32046293', '31952240', '30634639', '30154311', '28531135', '26501289', '24534922', '24231876', '22163538', '17170482', '17027377', '34064805', '26042327', '26042328', '27843754', '11605365', '26042330', '26042329', '34064805', '26042327', '26042328', '27843754', '11605365', '26042330']"
"A data-driven, kinematic feature-based, near real-time algorithm for injury severity prediction of vehicle occupants.","Wang, Qingfan; Gan, Shun; Chen, Wentao; Li, Quan; Nie, Bingbing",2021-04-29,"Accurate real-time prediction of occupant injury severity in unavoidable collision scenarios is a prerequisite for enhancing road traffic safety with the development of highly automated vehicles. Specifically, a safety prediction model provides a decision reference for the trajectory planning system in the pre-crash phase and the adaptive restraint system in the in-crash phase. The main goal of the current study is to construct a data-driven, vehicle kinematic feature-based model to realize accurate and near real-time prediction of in-vehicle occupant injury severity. A large-scale numerical database was established focusing on occupant kinetics. A first-step deep-learning model was established to predict occupant kinetics and injury severity using a convolutional neural network (CNN). To reduce the computational time for real-time application, the second step was to extract simplified kinematic features from vehicle crash pulses via a feature extraction method, which was inspired by a visualization approach applied to the CNN-based model. The features were incorporated with a low-complexity machine-learning algorithm and achieved satisfactory accuracy (85.4 % on the numerical database, 78.7 % on a 192-case real-world dataset) and decreased computational time (1.2 ± 0.4 ms) on the prediction tasks. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using data-driven and feature-based approaches to achieve accurate injury risk estimation prior to collision. The proposed model is expected to provide a decision reference for integrated safety systems in the next generation of automated vehicles.",33933716,10.1016/j.aap.2021.106149,pubmed,Journal Article,Injury risk; Machine-learning algorithms; Motor vehicle crashes; Occupant protection; Prediction models,"Accidents, Traffic; Algorithms; Biomechanical Phenomena; Databases, Factual; Humans; Neural Networks, Computer; Wounds and Injuries","['33933716', '26436222', '26436224', '37490328', '31322099', '32683130', '26845058', '29630403', '32777560', '31906716', '29087925', '25912100', '23683145', '25307377', '26436220', '27178370', '32599313', '29584491', '24060439', '30947250', '26436221', '35314363', '26027965', '26027963', '28296431', '19746308', '33341681', '26436246', '25307396', '21972861', '32125890', '33740462', '23343026', '31381380', '28095025', '20441858', '32105838', '25024013', '25307382', '33385620', '31774698', '19800833', '33066522', '24316501', '31514085', '17761544', '11322156', '21094304', '16707344', '26436219', '33212397', '24224566', '32751470', '12941251', '26027962', '33756425', '17946783', '24433115', '23137090', '11801410', '23259518', '26436231', '28384071', '32135304', '29360404', '31539280', '27594659', '12361515', '33818273', '32559658', '29203011', '28162916', '31381453', '26773695', '28947072', '31381452', '31381451', '36191455', '17632156', '24279966', '30296723', '36586232', '24279963', '33385957', '25269102', '31194597', '33453661', '33647597', '26436235', '29584493', '27586112', '19333823', '37659275', '35512783', '37493264', '37637800', '34060410', '33945355', '34600313', '38277854', '37943113', '34252581', '34894483', '34770076', '34298469', '34479121', '37976634', '36015850', '34365042', '34686068', '34874805', '37690284', '35856029', '33901716', '36015797', '34678617', '37560691', '35009899', '36366139', '35746294', '37346629', '34883970', '36634400', '34843416', '34200758', '37544041', '35408300', '35590880', '37847991', '34863526', '34987565', '34422912', '35785055', '34450796', '36502177', '24263362', '36991658', '32651789', '35458983', '37688005', '38311625', '36502000', '35785064', '37090433', '35062390', '35591128', '34520382', '37722256', '35422337', '35749570', '36010714', '34462631', '38267461', '37542122', '37760133', '34132137', '34796727', '35856029', '34683590', '33933716', '26436222', '26436224', '31322099', '32683130', '26845058', '33933716', '26436222', '26436224', '37490328', '31322099', '32683130', '33933716', '33933716']"

CapsField: Light Field-Based Face and Expression Recognition in the Wild Using Capsule Routing.,"Sepas-Moghaddam, Alireza; Etemad, Ali; Pereira, Fernando; Correia, Paulo Lobato",2021-02-05,"Light field (LF) cameras provide rich spatio-angular visual representations by sensing the visual scene from multiple perspectives and have recently emerged as a promising technology to boost the performance of human-machine systems such as biometrics and affective computing. Despite the significant success of LF representation for constrained facial image analysis, this technology has never been used for face and expression recognition in the wild. In this context, this paper proposes a new deep face and expression recognition solution, called CapsField, based on a convolutional neural network and an additional capsule network that utilizes dynamic routing to learn hierarchical relations between capsules. CapsField extracts the spatial features from facial images and learns the angular part-whole relations for a selected set of 2D sub-aperture images rendered from each LF image. To analyze the performance of the proposed solution in the wild, the first in the wild LF face dataset, along with a new complementary constrained face dataset captured from the same subjects recorded earlier have been captured and are made available. A subset of the in the wild dataset contains facial images with different expressions, annotated for usage in the context of face expression recognition tests. An extensive performance assessment study using the new datasets has been conducted for the proposed and relevant prior solutions, showing that the CapsField proposed solution achieves superior performance for both face and expression recognition tasks when compared to the state-of-the-art.",33523811,10.1109/TIP.2021.3054476,pubmed,Journal Article,No keywords,"Automated Facial Recognition; Deep Learning; Face; Facial Expression; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Male","['33523811', '32305901', '30418895', '34469297', '31395570', '30507525', '28129155', '31144624', '31329135', '33819156', '29994168', '31613762', '29993534', '33417545', '33291019', '33121101', '29757739', '33809038', '31180879', '35271103', '34038362', '30609846', '32380751', '33156789', '32937774', '31880541', '29901440', '32861915', '33201812', '25438312', '34824599', '33257223', '30530314', '30183620', '35164903', '28475048', '31935996', '29891830', '36306297', '32310806', '28613171', '31494561', '28783622', '33925371', '33439841', '33757182', '32340140', '29544790', '29990235', '15875792', '32992524', '32801058', '34665834', '29993435', '33217682', '29993707', '34667253', '32825666', '34705635', '34007266', '33074829', '32967087', '23529088', '33809352', '25419662', '31071019', '33208302', '33494516', '35591229', '16468569', '16602602', '29990036', '25532145', '31759371', '29414459', '33206189', '33582276', '19556198', '29771841', '31891902', '33807088', '25291808', '17283776', '31095477', '32070956', '30530311', '26685244', '15460279', '30669531', '32932939', '33123687', '26930681', '19717361', '28952940', '29727275', '36850618', '23708803', '27913345', '32485986', '29432093', '25222733', '26353135', '31248004', '25808772', '29993569', '30208648', '31009085', '17926699', '33270670', '33136542', '21079280', '31641865', '26394441', '35342228', '36473290', '34348035', '35437465', '34460805', '24316568', '33306479', '34648520', '35720931', '34833572', '34391000', '34161860', '38006736', '35275815', '34912534', '34451017', '36826957', '32857706', '35310577', '35341177', '35890934', '35702682', '37362639', '36455036', '37966926', '33196639', '35214430', '34033638', '35214248', '35604974', '35632169', '34502809', '36679725', '36682271', '35684825', '35847532', '32750831', '35180076', '35684841', '34460719', '37788215', '35684917', '34759808', '37362661', '35126077', '34418871', '36850537', '38150346', '32946386', '36934531', '35081028', '34182235', '32511098', '31983805', '34522730', '34460536', '35360665', '18776952', '33604732', '34321640', '37063528', '36261665', '36247359', '33523811', '32305901', '30418895', '34469297', '34348035', '35214430', '33523811', '32305901', '30418895', '34469297', '31395570', '30507525', '33523811', '34348035', '35214430', '34460536', '33523811', '34348035', '35214430', '34460536']"

Knowledge graphs are multi-relational, directed graph representations of domain knowledge. Recently, deep learning-based techniques have been gaining a lot of popularity. They can directly process these type of graphs or learn a low-dimensional numerical representation. While it has been shown empirically that these techniques achieve excellent predictive performances, they lack interpretability.

Dysgraphia detection through machine learning.,"Drotár, Peter; Dobeš, Marek",2020-12-09,"Dysgraphia, a disorder affecting the written expression of symbols and words, negatively impacts the academic results of pupils as well as their overall well-being. The use of automated procedures can make dysgraphia testing available to larger populations, thereby facilitating early intervention for those who need it. In this paper, we employed a machine learning approach to identify handwriting deteriorated by dysgraphia. To achieve this goal, we collected a new handwriting dataset consisting of several handwriting tasks and extracted a broad range of features to capture different aspects of handwriting. These were fed to a machine learning algorithm to predict whether handwriting is affected by dysgraphia. We compared several machine learning algorithms and discovered that the best results were achieved by the adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm. The results show that machine learning can be used to detect dysgraphia with almost 80% accuracy, even when dealing with a heterogeneous set of subjects differing in age, sex and handedness.",33299092,10.1038/s41598-020-78611-9,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,Adolescent; Agraphia; Algorithms; Case-Control Studies; Child; Data Accuracy; Female; Handwriting; Humans; Machine Learning; Male,"['33299092', '37299942', '34770333', '32915793', '24139714', '36181958', '32081940', '36850364', '26132164', '23544813', '3390361', '7539228', '28948860', '31518720', '32602447', '29689111', '19432056', '31304322', '20373859', '25156696', '2804886', '26517047', '7805390', '21103706', '24674964', '38136127', '29605507', '24770471', '21315553', '7969867', '23911278', '24321409', '9220265', '9388804', '26037277', '29157129', '26874552', '1884188', '33019305', '26106566', '14203089', '9191761', '12994518', '17710822', '14080277', '17011656', '28199175', '22515913', '4058715', '23747934', '11104545', '33090110', '17538196', '36291371', '14091702', '36983754', '15629207', '19945252', '14345849', '34106816', '13298380', '28906170', '10716867', '28126631', '21269805', '2713968', '32866108', '28741400', '29749112', '10953242', '21106191', '38181607', '35722168', '36417548', '27610128', '10788743', '9106281', '2377407', '17376144', '29748041', '30157018', '2197300', '2758569', '10449137', '14640316', '20672223', '27989606', '29940788', '11300701', '15473167', '30761210', '32773372', '37930468', '12030487', '17111567', '22231056', '17982901', '6466166', '28407777', '23816628', '14624833', '28210599', '9885749', '10924221', '26642967', '10696493', '37779578', '36517669', '35601625', '36086649', '35005797', '33461684', '38364361', '34734115', '37761473', '34604527', '12519809', '34585237', '34753948', '34045742', '37205257', '37205246', '31304383', '31304382', '37299942', '36983754', '36517669', '38136127', '37779578', '37508593', '37360459', '37340079', '37299942', '36983754', '36517669', '35035266', '34770333', '33716812', '33299092', '37299942', '34770333', '32915793', '7539228', '25156696', '33299092', '37299942', '34770333', '32915793', '24139714', '36181958', '32915793', '31304382', '31304322', '31046995', '30761210', '28948860', '28906176', '27148135', '26685156', '26336330', '25265632', '25156696', '24321409', '24237283', '24139714', '23816628', '20933228', '19818437', '19432056', '17011656', '33299092', '7539228', '25156696', '26517047', '17376144', '2197300', '17982901', '34585237', '33299092', '7539228', '25156696', '26517047', '17376144', '2197300']"
Text mining approaches for dealing with the rapidly expanding literature on COVID-19.,"Wang, Lucy Lu; Lo, Kyle",No date,"More than 50 000 papers have been published about COVID-19 since the beginning of 2020 and several hundred new papers continue to be published every day. This incredible rate of scientific productivity leads to information overload, making it difficult for researchers, clinicians and public health officials to keep up with the latest findings. Automated text mining techniques for searching, reading and summarizing papers are helpful for addressing information overload. In this review, we describe the many resources that have been introduced to support text mining applications over the COVID-19 literature; specifically, we discuss the corpora, modeling resources, systems and shared tasks that have been introduced for COVID-19. We compile a list of 39 systems that provide functionality such as search, discovery, visualization and summarization over the COVID-19 literature. For each system, we provide a qualitative description and assessment of the system's performance, unique data or user interface features and modeling decisions. Many systems focus on search and discovery, though several systems provide novel features, such as the ability to summarize findings over multiple documents or linking between scientific articles and clinical trials. We also describe the public corpora, models and shared tasks that have been introduced to help reduce repeated effort among community members; some of these resources (especially shared tasks) can provide a basis for comparing the performance of different systems. Finally, we summarize promising results and open challenges for text mining the COVID-19 literature.",33279995,10.1093/bib/bbaa296,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",CORD-19; COVID-19; information extraction; information retrieval; natural language processing; question answering; shared tasks; summarization; text mining,COVID-19; Data Mining; Humans; SARS-CoV-2,"['33279995', '33166392', '34465169', '32451808', '33835932', '33739287', '28475312', '35713856', '25510606', '19957157', '31501885', '32510522', '25641519', '21063956', '29208328', '36197453', '33617460', '30689846', '29650307', '33419870', '32604797', '20841825', '26184780', '33180112', '29906584', '21106487', '32921303', '27165558', '29961081', '32970973', '27216254', '30576489', '27888231', '25881313', '33108306', '37853031', '24070668', '32287039', '22665627', '31627150', '34042709', '27538578', '33526252', '30857950', '34138726', '23633944', '21133848', '32659695', '33079693', '33314026', '34042772', '28875048', '33175693', '33323109', '23249606', '18834487', '28688492', '33267765', '35671034', '25935162', '34713057', '30717659', '22511921', '31383477', '26277115', '33485207', '26551925', '34495798', '29954318', '32571302', '30639392', '26163487', '26099853', '26587051', '28414821', '34337589', '23434632', '30848465', '25886734', '33497351', '33787871', '23255168', '33152084', '37359325', '20074663', '30848457', '28025348', '33416890', '19654114', '34375298', '33846532', '33757278', '33831536', '20529930', '36464228', '36938926', '34640749', '35951425', '35104642', '34179855', '36342236', '36618881', '35235184', '36347537', '36120163', '30692868', '34638171', '35655148', '34387462', '37474900', '33870056', '21170175', '33913279', '35673133', '25309356', '37025650', '35002094', '34178569', '36011614', '18629031', '37038542', '34574567', '24808858', '31587990', '34025086', '37425425', '33364629', '22778730', '36292516', '34587042', '29568821', '36351703', '34927002', '35782365', '21347172', '21992545', '32365018', '35346974', '33870034', '36009848', '37250180', '33223580', '35449502', '34290386', '34012603', '32648294', '33280626', '33348360', '33343371', '33341893', '33341884', '33333559', '33320936', '33288947', '33285568', '33285567', '33285566', '33284347', '33284331', '33284328', '33284314', '33282214', '33281435', '33281107', '33280263', '33280033', '33419870', '33600346', '37725432', '37697152', '37520616', '37485423', '36678737', '36568257', '36560764', '36462150', '36347537', '36217352', '36009848', '35915735', '35846129', '35782886', '35717167', '35454109', '35453935', '35335943', '34585729', '34479397', '34479389', '34339864', '34245913', '34124535', '33279995', '33166392', '34465169', '32451808', '33835932', '28475312', '33279995', '33166392', '34465169', '32451808', '33835932', '33739287', '33279995', '34465169', '28475312', '19957157', '25641519', '33600346', '26184780', '21106487', '27165558', '27888231', '24070668', '27538578', '30857950', '21133848', '32659695', '28875048', '33267765', '25935162', '31383477', '33284779', '26587051', '30848465', '23255168', '36464228', '25309356', '36009848', '33279995', '34465169', '28475312', '19957157', '25641519', '33600346']"

Improved Scaffold Hopping in Ligand-Based Virtual Screening Using Neural Representation Learning.,"Stojanović, Luka; Popović, Miloš; Tijanić, Nebojša; Rakočević, Goran; Kalinić, Marko",2020-08-19,"Deep learning has demonstrated significant potential in advancing state of the art in many problem domains, especially those benefiting from automated feature extraction. Yet, the methodology has seen limited adoption in the field of ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) as traditional approaches typically require large, target-specific training sets, which limits their value in most prospective applications. Here, we report the development of a neural network architecture and a learning framework designed to yield a generally applicable tool for LBVS. Our approach uses the molecular graph as input and involves learning a representation that places compounds of similar biological profiles in close proximity within a hyperdimensional feature space; this is achieved by simultaneously leveraging historical screening data against a multitude of targets during training. Cosine distance between molecules in this space becomes a general similarity metric and can readily be used to rank order database compounds in LBVS workflows. We demonstrate the resulting model generalizes exceptionally well to compounds and targets not used in its training. In three commonly employed LBVS benchmarks, our method outperforms popular fingerprinting algorithms without the need for any target-specific training. Moreover, we show the learned representation yields superior performance in scaffold hopping tasks and is largely orthogonal to existing fingerprints. Summarily, we have developed and validated a framework for learning a molecular representation that is applicable to LBVS in a target-agnostic fashion, with as few as one query compound. Our approach can also enable organizations to generate additional value from large screening data repositories, and to this end we are making its implementation freely available at https://github.com/totient-bio/gatnn-vs.",32786700,10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00622,pubmed,Journal Article,No keywords,"Algorithms; Databases, Factual; Ligands; Neural Networks, Computer; Prospective Studies","['32786700', '37630234', '33497572', '25182364', '36154119', '28220440', '32092614', '35007471', '34774103', '25750664', '36410391', '35324898', '30525594', '20684607', '37734134', '19926897', '30977780', '31377536', '32392062', '21438544', '35022993', '36057182', '30598075', '16045308', '31443612', '30499744', '33759134', '29544790', '36008947', '36268146', '32228116', '31687007', '30417778', '36805261', '31586788', '32140104', '23259841', '30808287', '33310483', '36421733', '33095006', '35348582', '33508772', '17125186', '29982330', '32871338', '18447336', '31288752', '30026067', '37794460', '31588387', '31349729', '26269925', '33018251', '32281797', '29993534', '25448759', '34020133', '31630012', '33621167', '31860296', '34878785', '33181405', '35187297', '27491652', '21761904', '34619030', '29185065', '32804365', '26119231', '31650386', '19685924', '36994428', '33871989', '29882343', '32053156', '27019494', '32657370', '29495922', '32344155', '31760248', '37552222', '31771647', '31779342', '17951843', '32657357', '33892256', '30278128', '37001208', '32163118', '35330605', '30136285', '37432499', '31346949', '32765639', '31416558', '21819157', '32312232', '24328054', '21826555', '29870348', '35604356', '32780040', '29516311', '33180488', '32804361', '31787076', '31916049', '37020333', '32568539', '35216273', '34270903', '32776875', '36279588', '22249773', '32639154', '32195587', '37448813', '37885017', '35869511', '34251814', '32750823', '35213804', '35279188', '36091415', '35649855', '32250616', '34101587', '35131567', '33899481', '23561266', '32202780', '32955876', '24688702', '34925492', '32966072', '35783179', '23131020', '36632611', '20150995', '35938711', '37630234', '37466636', '35576813', '34774103', '34584636', '34563271', '32786700', '33497572', '25182364', '36154119', '30499744', '32228116', '32786700', '37630234', '33497572', '25182364', '36154119', '28220440', '32786700', '30499744', '32228116', '30417778', '26269925', '25448759', '32804365', '32804361', '24688702', '32786700', '30499744', '32228116', '30417778', '26269925', '25448759']"
PleThora: Pleural effusion and thoracic cavity segmentations in diseased lungs for benchmarking chest CT processing pipelines.,"Kiser, Kendall J; Ahmed, Sara; Stieb, Sonja; Mohamed, Abdallah S R; Elhalawani, Hesham; Park, Peter Y S; Doyle, Nathan S; Wang, Brandon J; Barman, Arko; Li, Zhao; Zheng, W Jim; Fuller, Clifton D; Giancardo, Luca",2020-08-28,"This manuscript describes a dataset of thoracic cavity segmentations and discrete pleural effusion segmentations we have annotated on 402 computed tomography (CT) scans acquired from patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The segmentation of these anatomic regions precedes fundamental tasks in image analysis pipelines such as lung structure segmentation, lesion detection, and radiomics feature extraction. Bilateral thoracic cavity volumes and pleural effusion volumes were manually segmented on CT scans acquired from The Cancer Imaging Archive ""NSCLC Radiomics"" data collection. Four hundred and two thoracic segmentations were first generated automatically by a U-Net based algorithm trained on chest CTs without cancer, manually corrected by a medical student to include the complete thoracic cavity (normal, pathologic, and atelectatic lung parenchyma, lung hilum, pleural effusion, fibrosis, nodules, tumor, and other anatomic anomalies), and revised by a radiation oncologist or a radiologist. Seventy-eight pleural effusions were manually segmented by a medical student and revised by a radiologist or radiation oncologist. Interobserver agreement between the radiation oncologist and radiologist corrections was acceptable. All expert-vetted segmentations are publicly available in NIfTI format through The Cancer Imaging Archive at https://doi.org/10.7937/tcia.2020.6c7y-gq39. Tabular data detailing clinical and technical metadata linked to segmentation cases are also available. Thoracic cavity segmentations will be valuable for developing image analysis pipelines on pathologic lungs - where current automated algorithms struggle most. In conjunction with gross tumor volume segmentations already available from ""NSCLC Radiomics,"" pleural effusion segmentations may be valuable for investigating radiomics profile differences between effusion and primary tumor or training algorithms to discriminate between them.",32749075,10.1002/mp.14424,pubmed,Journal Article,computer-aided decision support systems; image processing; image segmentation techniques; informatics in imaging; quantitative imaging,"Algorithms; Benchmarking; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Humans; Lung; Lung Neoplasms; Pleural Effusion; Thoracic Cavity; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","['32749075', '34892074', '28789867', '35797580', '34027588', '16928526', '28550270', '30958323', '19826872', '32128809', '25086546', '28205306', '25956936', '23686175', '25350526', '24989390', '23927326', '31354393', '35701415', '15350582', '36028289', '23816819', '11516851', '20399688', '24951204', '28295386', '21625182', '30998808', '10757610', '31439255', '35348244', '26847203', '23020972', '33411267', '30286184', '25591989', '27447897', '35817338', '8063661', '32750948', '30957936', '22898692', '26349914', '9172714', '25957746', '17574128', '29080491', '26172351', '18367801', '34350406', '20346728', '23073526', '30602393', '28594880', '8827804', '31450540', '37869619', '23745281', '10210486', '27587033', '31978149', '34139383', '9207521', '19746795', '15105451', '26115366', '38177130', '37493348', '32016133', '26112055', '32096876', '16092334', '24784800', '26688067', '34327625', '21620581', '8470614', '23062953', '31494946', '32786071', '8708762', '30840717', '26689234', '35330920', '28891217', '25587349', '38031040', '23632863', '28035663', '35905695', '14752878', '29494598', '30097402', '38076518', '37994150', '34841480', '37149920', '35452142', '32521049', '33840636', '37370621', '32728098', '24346241', '37387370', '30344991', '32772385', '25281960', '34587294', '38268601', '33706149', '34861641', '32939632', '35965430', '36582483', '29204230', '35693265', '36949088', '35341291', '34885094', '23766939', '20407621', '25494501', '34340104', '34750736', '30911649', '37077858', '34201021', '32206688', '34697567', '37540449', '35758798', '37583562', '38151565', '33241265', '35893082', '37277095', '36605537', '20628545', '33153754', '33969313', '31082123', '34785700', '38298996', '36478606', '37618782', '37095067', '38359925', '34795813', '34167858', '38095296', '31543691', '35375260', '20774920', '38337853', '37064789', '36993838', '36574737', '36248019', '36158520', '36135401', '35797580', '35578654', '35330920', '34898850', '34748101', '34698988', '34139383', '34027588', '33932751', '33760731', '33285482', '32749075', '34892074', '28789867', '35797580', '22898692', '26172351', '32749075', '34892074', '28789867', '35797580', '34027588', '16928526', '32814998', '32613207', '31956545', '31396776', '31355226', '31110349', '30840717', '30605097', '30453165', '30415174', '30144101', '29955159', '29641601', '28968445', '28749127', '28656381', '28550270', '28376237', '28233652', '27705854', '26978244', '26945974', '26886978', '26323029', '26200610', '26172351', '25467805', '25020069', '24892406', '24600388', '23884657', '23686175', '23632863', '23372069', '22898692', '20399688', '16545965', '11437109', '843571', '32749075', '22898692', '26172351', '35965430', '25494501', '32749075', '22898692', '26172351', '35965430', '25494501']"
Artificial intelligence and radiomics in pediatric molecular imaging.,"Wagner, Matthias W; Bilbily, Alexander; Beheshti, Mohsen; Shammas, Amer; Vali, Reza",2020-06-13,"In the past decade, a new approach for quantitative analysis of medical images and prognostic modelling has emerged. Defined as the extraction and analysis of a large number of quantitative parameters from medical images, radiomics is an evolving field in precision medicine with the ultimate goal of the discovery of new imaging biomarkers for disease. Radiomics has already shown promising results in extracting diagnostic, prognostic, and molecular information latent in medical images. After acquisition of the medical images as part of the standard of care, a region of interest is defined often via a manual or semi-automatic approach. An algorithm then extracts and computes quantitative radiomics parameters from the region of interest. Whereas radiomics captures quantitative values of shape and texture based on predefined mathematical terms, neural networks have recently been used to directly learn and identify predictive features from medical images. Thereby, neural networks largely forego the need for so called ""hand-engineered"" features, which appears to result in significantly improved performance and reliability. Opportunities for radiomics and neural networks in pediatric nuclear medicine/radiology/molecular imaging are broad and can be thought of in three categories: automating well-defined administrative or clinical tasks, augmenting broader administrative or clinical tasks, and unlocking new methods of generating value. Specific applications include intelligent order sets, automated protocoling, improved image acquisition, computer aided triage and detection of abnormalities, next generation voice dictation systems, biomarker development, and therapy planning.",32544594,10.1016/j.ymeth.2020.06.008,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Review",Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Molecular imaging; Nuclear medicine; Pediatric radiology; Radiomics,"Child; Datasets as Topic; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Medical Oncology; Molecular Imaging; Neural Networks, Computer; Patient Care Planning; Pediatrics; Prognosis; Reproducibility of Results; Telemedicine; Triage","['32544594', '32615232', '32397702', '33765601', '36468301', '34213702', '33718055', '34309893', '28687979', '32647917', '31673788', '34513082', '33242898', '35433024', '35381490', '30867832', '32504782', '32522530', '33778721', '29728226', '32143788', '31280350', '31712961', '32697964', '29398494', '35028877', '28168275', '31820014', '33085029', '37499847', '34537858', '36238997', '32060219', '29730736', '28423406', '34275550', '36514226', '31538516', '22898692', '34460760', '30548601', '31527578', '30657374', '31470936', '32564769', '33709608', '32101448', '32096876', '34435228', '30481928', '35803254', '34202096', '33431509', '25025374', '31739125', '33264805', '31645301', '35131965', '32296901', '31991420', '31240403', '33714900', '30952559', '31401616', '32047333', '29385618', '32779173', '31487307', '32166491', '32034573', '32209816', '28595812', '30279049', '30898263', '37727910', '31629933', '31527579', '31698575', '35561699', '30383900', '31240330', '34990929', '34809866', '31190176', '33662856', '30064704', '35251962', '30374837', '32517801', '31481588', '31690962', '32524780', '30350006', '33693966', '35160069', '33596552', '30370508', '31950592', '28490744', '32821953', '29308604', '34191197', '31650960', '36907973', '33521637', '32594406', '29092951', '29131760', '37189155', '36182633', '38179181', '35406426', '31080889', '34649914', '34597235', '37747582', '35756864', '37935406', '35809090', '36384049', '36197822', '37175014', '34109326', '34319165', '37046521', '26579733', '35339254', '32872466', '35880549', '37037684', '38286723', '36016617', '36831517', '34825946', '36842730', '35411748', '37632823', '34902669', '35661199', '34925606', '38352179', '35495063', '36968604', '35344132', '29488709', '37486507', '38013345', '35681585', '36831401', '38089752', '36836457', '34853638', '36639175', '28815113', '36990587', '34987940', '35483269', '32500316', '37287746', '36858729', '33592236', '33336451', '25481515', '38192376', '35884409', '35701372', '12003672', '35311122', '35545101', '37035771', '35812228', '34815630', '37727204', '37754935', '36741005', '35463760', '36874107', '36212407', '36611441', '36864193', '37916171', '33498680', '33151391', '36927442', '34537858', '34513082', '34202321', '37316589', '36959318', '36951989', '36016617', '35831452', '35712463', '34046708', '32544594', '32615232', '32397702', '33765601', '36468301', '34213702', '32544594', '32615232', '32397702', '33765601', '36468301', '34213702', '32544594', '32615232', '32397702', '33765601', '34213702', '33718055', '34309893', '28687979', '32647917', '30867832', '34513082', '32504782', '32522530', '33778721', '29728226', '31280350', '32697964', '29398494', '35028877', '28168275', '31820014', '33085029', '34537858', '36238997', '32060219', '34275550', '31538516', '22898692', '31527578', '33059822', '30657374', '31470936', '33431509', '32564769', '32101448', '34435228', '35803254', '34202096', '31739125', '33264805', '30383900', '32296901', '31991420', '31240403', '35251962', '31401616', '32047333', '32779173', '29308604', '32034573', '32209816', '28595812', '30898263', '30575178', '31629933', '31527579', '31698575', '35561699', '31190176', '31240330', '34990929', '34809866', '33662856', '30064704', '30374837', '32517801', '31481588', '31690962', '32524780', '33693966', '35160069', '30370508', '31950592', '32821953', '34191197', '31650960', '36907973', '33521637', '32594406', '29131760', '37189155', '36182633', '35406426', '35756864', '34649914', '35809090', '36384049', '36967355', '34790581', '36197822', '37175014', '34319165', '37046521', '34676470', '35339254', '35766531', '36016617', '36831517', '34825946', '34902669', '35344132', '34987940', '34897550', '35681585', '36836457', '34853638', '36639175', '36858729', '35884409', '35545101', '37035771', '36180328', '32544594', '32615232', '32397702', '33765601', '34213702', '33718055']"
Discovering the hidden messages within cell trajectories using a deep learning approach for in vitro evaluation of cancer drug treatments.,"Mencattini, A; Di Giuseppe, D; Comes, M C; Casti, P; Corsi, F; Bertani, F R; Ghibelli, L; Businaro, L; Di Natale, C; Parrini, M C; Martinelli, E",2020-05-06,"We describe a novel method to achieve a universal, massive, and fully automated analysis of cell motility behaviours, starting from time-lapse microscopy images. The approach was inspired by the recent successes in application of machine learning for style recognition in paintings and artistic style transfer. The originality of the method relies i) on the generation of atlas from the collection of single-cell trajectories in order to visually encode the multiple descriptors of cell motility, and ii) on the application of pre-trained Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network architecture in order to extract relevant features to be used for classification tasks from this visual atlas. Validation tests were conducted on two different cell motility scenarios: 1) a 3D biomimetic gels of immune cells, co-cultured with breast cancer cells in organ-on-chip devices, upon treatment with an immunotherapy drug; 2) Petri dishes of clustered prostate cancer cells, upon treatment with a chemotherapy drug. For each scenario, single-cell trajectories are very accurately classified according to the presence or not of the drugs.

Linear embedding by joint Robust Discriminant Analysis and Inter-class Sparsity.,"Dornaika, F; Khoder, A",2020-04-22,"Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and its variants are widely used as feature extraction methods. They have been used for different classification tasks. However, these methods have some limitations that need to be overcome. The main limitation is that the projection obtained by LDA does not provide a good interpretability for the features. In this paper, we propose a novel supervised method used for multi-class classification that simultaneously performs feature selection and extraction. The targeted projection transformation focuses on the most discriminant original features, and at the same time, makes sure that the transformed features (extracted features) belonging to each class have common sparsity. Our proposed method is called Robust Discriminant Analysis with Feature Selection and Inter-class Sparsity (RDA_FSIS). The corresponding model integrates two types of sparsity. The first type is obtained by imposing the ℓ2,1 constraint on the projection matrix in order to perform feature selection. The second type of sparsity is obtained by imposing the inter-class sparsity constraint used for ensuring a common sparsity structure in each class. An orthogonal matrix is also introduced in our model in order to guarantee that the extracted features can retain the main variance of the original data and thus improve the robustness to noise. The proposed method retrieves the LDA transformation by taking into account the two types of sparsity. Various experiments are conducted on several image datasets including faces, objects and digits. The projected features are used for multi-class classification. Obtained results show that the proposed method outperforms other competing methods by learning a more compact and discriminative transformation.",32361379,10.1016/j.neunet.2020.04.018,pubmed,Journal Article,Feature extraction; Feature selection; Image classification; Inter-class sparsity; Linear discriminant analysis,"Algorithms; Databases, Factual; Discriminant Analysis; Humans; Pattern Recognition, Automated","['32361379', '33422928', '30660101', '35537483', '29524766', '33877998', '30408694', '23852218', '21521666', '23529087', '31063926', '21075720', '28651080', '17945714', '18179076', '16468619', '27429445', '22027372', '18270092', '30216870', '24805043', '16900667', '15943424', '28198354', '25993706', '31502975', '25320823', '19336330', '29096201', '27296013', '37126629', '21693417', '15940983', '24816629', '37729791', '17153955', '27911905', '26311394', '15628264', '24819874', '23764874', '22097255', '26572145', '21096912', '16468577', '21079273', '20003274', '16722172', '17131668', '34487507', '30959875', '17699917', '33055053', '25291733', '37167052', '24732237', '23488130', '25666892', '26540686', '16128451', '23708805', '17431299', '20229900', '16903378', '34166212', '24010269', '17299222', '22831850', '24657572', '28910778', '15688560', '16240767', '32446190', '19441177', '16447988', '17933851', '19095532', '28767370', '33297389', '18842480', '24808557', '29744809', '33502996', '24579172', '30176594', '24212037', '19163851', '27416030', '32082407', '15619939', '27257882', '16886863', '26513817', '23568506', '23144037', '17108382', '33687854', '18348919', '23893760', '26737968', '30959760', '30903947', '26685273', '23782842', '16526484', '27852213', '36072737', '23874661', '33667167', '36109581', '37890419', '33319332', '35867370', '37796670', '34546929', '16856670', '31982674', '33147149', '34357859', '34874851', '24714390', '32112684', '37409076', '34648443', '33180734', '32971862', '33090953', '34818202', '29297140', '27294886', '24701144', '33984737', '34764624', '32887087', '32502799', '22323898', '33382663', '32386179', '33736604', '36395136', '24982970', '20351889', '36564421', '37022041', '24294336', '33739448', '24453791', '33798087', '32095790', '24688449', '24078896', '37674977', '36283288', '36827960', '36092461', '24707201', '35333712', '24077217', '18769656', '36033591', '37845723', '33434122', '34236660', '35439128', '37030755', '36037628', '35286272', '36121958', '38156117', '32926363', '34343342', '36155441', '32916982', '36334814', '37546547', '32406845', '21544257', '37018309', '35945147', '37982129', '34449394', '22163476', '32992848', '33182205', '24632658', '33019303', '19169416', '32746282', '35814863', '32440369', '25785311', '31379403', '36033587', '37485992', '37361377', '36814817', '36176279', '32361379', '33422928', '30660101', '35537483', '29524766', '33877998', '32361379', '33422928', '30660101', '35537483', '29524766', '33877998', '32361379', '32361379']"
Phase-synchrony evaluation of EEG signals for Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis based on bivariate empirical mode decomposition during a visual task.,"Raeisi, Khadijeh; Mohebbi, Maryam; Khazaei, Mohammad; Seraji, Masoud; Yoonessi, Ali",2019-12-30,"Despite the widespread prevalence of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), the study of brain interactions is still poorly understood. Moreover, there has always been a great need to automate the MS diagnosis procedure to eliminate the evaluation errors thereby improving its consistency and reliability. To address these issues, in this work, we proposed a robust pattern recognition algorithm as a computer-aided diagnosis system. This method is based on calculating the pairwise phase-synchrony of EEG recordings during a visual task. Initially, the bivariate empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) was applied to extract the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). The phases of these IMFs were then obtained using the Hilbert transform to be utilized in the mean phase coherence (MPC), a measure for phase-synchrony calculation. After the construction of the feature space using MPC values, the ReliefF algorithm was applied for dimension reduction. Finally, the best distinguishing features were input to a k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier. The results revealed a higher level of network synchronization in the posterior regions of the brain and desynchronization in the anterior regions among the MS group as compared with the normal subjects. In the validation phase, the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method was used to assess the validity of the proposed algorithm. We achieved an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 93.09%, 91.07%, and 95.24% for red-green, 90.44%, 88.39%, and 92.62% for luminance, and 87.44%, 87.05%, and 87.86% for blue-yellow tasks, respectively.

Unsupervised AER Object Recognition Based on Multiscale Spatio-Temporal Features and Spiking Neurons.,"Liu, Qianhui; Pan, Gang; Ruan, Haibo; Xing, Dong; Xu, Qi; Tang, Huajin",2020-11-30,"This article proposes an unsupervised address event representation (AER) object recognition approach. The proposed approach consists of a novel multiscale spatio-temporal feature (MuST) representation of input AER events and a spiking neural network (SNN) using spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) for object recognition with MuST. MuST extracts the features contained in both the spatial and temporal information of AER event flow, and forms an informative and compact feature spike representation. We show not only how MuST exploits spikes to convey information more effectively, but also how it benefits the recognition using SNN. The recognition process is performed in an unsupervised manner, which does not need to specify the desired status of every single neuron of SNN, and thus can be flexibly applied in real-world recognition tasks. The experiments are performed on five AER datasets including a new one named GESTURE-DVS. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach.",32054587,10.1109/TNNLS.2020.2966058,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,"Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Simulation; Databases, Factual; Electronic Data Processing; Humans; Models, Neurological; Neural Networks, Computer; Neurons; Pattern Recognition, Automated","['32054587', '23340243', '29328958', '33291017', '31963143', '36793542', '29894846', '37666759', '29994102', '23994510', '37549609', '37152590', '30776985', '30190670', '20876015', '26353184', '17305422', '37631767', '33353527', '29993898', '22830962', '33519366', '31499357', '29674234', '31714243', '16722179', '31586857', '30880526', '22386500', '31726331', '25347889', '22027373', '36620452', '34108870', '32673197', '31593843', '18706787', '24508754', '16526488', '34114566', '27867346', '9113533', '30361729', '20053732', '29677839', '34713667', '30429767', '30944983', '31003417', '21047704', '37004546', '37893257', '29080474', '19635693', '32866745', '29946249', '32733224', '32528239', '33557214', '25602775', '36376426', '23500504', '31733521', '29875621', '26941637', '36275955', '19783402', '22792056', '30941003', '24867390', '25035965', '25088692', '35995020', '24681923', '33979292', '31590013', '17550118', '16566505', '19922291', '30813574', '34507042', '23912503', '33324153', '28269017', '17097334', '23853281', '16722183', '22615855', '23895051', '17699925', '17627045', '14995489', '27857680', '15971912', '32941136', '25291733', '24833593', '18846203', '15943421', '27079422', '32174804', '31780729', '23852979', '35436369', '32415108', '17989091', '22745001', '29209191', '31447634', '22736650', '27416030', '28066221', '19457750', '37585615', '33606643', '37378016', '29951198', '37144088', '37640808', '37450365', '37827068', '33502972', '34506281', '35085071', '37609449', '36408382', '32203038', '36359633', '32584773', '36242247', '26729123', '30669628', '33707537', '25078110', '34705647', '37943649', '33566757', '34418872', '37022405', '36545536', '33200621', '36427283', '36161161', '38027484', '37666759', '37004546', '35498182', '32054587', '23340243', '29328958', '33291017', '31726331', '24508754', '32054587', '23340243', '29328958', '33291017', '31963143', '36793542', '32054587', '31726331', '24508754', '34713667', '32054587', '31726331', '24508754', '34713667']"
Two-Stream Attention Network for Pain Recognition from Video Sequences.,"Thiam, Patrick; Kestler, Hans A; Schwenker, Friedhelm",2020-02-04,"Several approaches have been proposed for the analysis of pain-related facial expressions. These approaches range from common classification architectures based on a set of carefully designed handcrafted features, to deep neural networks characterised by an autonomous extraction of relevant facial descriptors and simultaneous optimisation of a classification architecture. In the current work, an end-to-end approach based on attention networks for the analysis and recognition of pain-related facial expressions is proposed. The method combines both spatial and temporal aspects of facial expressions through a weighted aggregation of attention-based neural networks' outputs, based on sequences of Motion History Images (MHIs) and Optical Flow Images (OFIs). Each input stream is fed into a specific attention network consisting of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) coupled to a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). An attention mechanism generates a single weighted representation of each input stream (MHI sequence and OFI sequence), which is subsequently used to perform specific classification tasks. Simultaneously, a weighted aggregation of the classification scores specific to each input stream is performed to generate a final classification output. The assessment conducted on both the BioVid Heat Pain Database (Part A) and SenseEmotion Database points at the relevance of the proposed approach, as its classification performance is on par with state-of-the-art classification approaches proposed in the literature.",32033240,10.3390/s20030839,pubmed,Journal Article,"convolutional neural networks, long short-term memory recurrent neural networks, information fusion, pain recognition","Algorithms; Attention; Calibration; Databases, Factual; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Face; Facial Expression; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Machine Learning; Memory, Short-Term; Models, Statistical; Neural Networks, Computer; Pain; Pain Measurement; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Temperature; Video Recording","['32033240', '32224465', '31627305', '29993796', '31760248', '30103029', '30835222', '28783622', '34756219', '30951163', '31641370', '29404850', '33019243', '32028568', '32079299', '37420815', '28475048', '27847543', '31586788', '30510672', '34665834', '32340140', '31421868', '33809038', '35588948', '30376567', '36365785', '30669531', '28207407', '30700331', '29366586', '36921434', '15875792', '31963623', '31416555', '31683145', '30763637', '33513723', '31329135', '36711196', '20847386', '34770262', '37062964', '34068462', '29994572', '33562612', '34206077', '31059443', '38005489', '37294411', '36146186', '29727275', '31107876', '32797099', '31935996', '22745001', '16602602', '29324413', '30540804', '31933675', '36146119', '37800207', '31425939', '33735660', '34330253', '30518132', '35062558', '29544790', '26886976', '31915519', '31416556', '29936360', '36896393', '29778931', '32331463', '32380751', '34283094', '29757739', '35746417', '33479405', '34614809', '29113103', '35733557', '30210533', '21757322', '31940558', '29763743', '34970310', '30477892', '34925485', '31041697', '35898070', '29994075', '32822348', '25910269', '30714197', '33670835', '29650319', '31319945', '34138403', '29623089', '38053884', '36060497', '38257546', '38006210', '37972510', '38313204', '38139503', '37399164', '38083549', '38184347', '35965749', '37384648', '37924607', '35622807', '38139521', '38067977', '37660111', '38083426', '38250021', '38343251', '38051626', '37995171', '36685641', '38241103', '37943638', '38322690', '32201857', '38077594', '37498757', '38083481', '36085867', '37631629', '37362654', '35586087', '35139564', '34539444', '34064987', '33804987', '32033240', '31627305', '29993796', '31760248', '34206077', '28861708', '32033240', '32224465', '31627305', '29993796', '31760248', '30103029', '31627305', '30906508', '30713485', '30441611', '28603478', '28207407', '21278824', '18502049', '17431293', '9377276', '32033240', '34206077', '28861708', '31925551', '32804361', '34020551', '33373304', '35150109', '34577321', '36764062', '34481767', '33652728', '32033240', '34206077', '28861708', '31925551', '32804361', '34020551']"
Accurate Hand Detection from Single-Color Images by Reconstructing Hand Appearances.,"Xu, Chi; Cai, Wendi; Li, Yongbo; Zhou, Jun; Wei, Longsheng",2019-12-29,"Hand detection is a crucial pre-processing procedure for many human hand related computer vision tasks, such as hand pose estimation, hand gesture recognition, human activity analysis, and so on. However, reliably detecting multiple hands from cluttering scenes remains to be a challenging task because of complex appearance diversities of dexterous human hands (e.g., different hand shapes, skin colors, illuminations, orientations, and scales, etc.) in color images. To tackle this problem, an accurate hand detection method is proposed to reliably detect multiple hands from a single color image using a hybrid detection/reconstruction convolutional neural networks (CNN) framework, in which regions of hands are detected and appearances of hands are reconstructed in parallel by sharing features extracted from a region proposal layer, and the proposed model is trained in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, it is observed that the generative adversarial network (GAN) could further boost the detection performance by generating more realistic hand appearances. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on public challenging hand detection benchmarks.",31905746,10.3390/s20010192,pubmed,Journal Article,convolutional neural networks; generative adversarial network; hand appearance reconstruction; hands detection; human–computer interaction,"Color; Databases as Topic; Hand; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Models, Theoretical; Neural Networks, Computer","['31905746', '29990193', '31002188', '31266251', '35891011', '30031932', '31801226', '36248935', '32442627', '32285343', '33672934', '32142439', '33923320', '30501859', '31369994', '31751268', '33826515', '32736069', '30791500', '33631607', '37765849', '29993927', '33962124', '34198408', '31222531', '30010548', '30575046', '30444906', '32937774', '34198042', '29650319', '32915739', '30889282', '26738016', '30618707', '31480461', '32658793', '32872565', '30111995', '31299053', '31006909', '30594770', '34960294', '31425939', '29889095', '30835211', '30869619', '31765986', '29994246', '30840685', '31292287', '28850876', '29870376', '31327058', '29624729', '31003547', '31589460', '31634122', '32248106', '33074200', '30136285', '31319945', '30376567', '31220353', '31691975', '29994168', '31947496', '29378580', '31727057', '32030665', '28254085', '30781737', '33125327', '17393559', '34364792', '30231472', '30714911', '31200901', '31586858', '30692071', '26886969', '31830973', '17271984', '28762196', '29993435', '30790344', '26660697', '30117945', '29994314', '31732864', '33074807', '34819900', '29035212', '31309728', '32873639', '34960562', '36179009', '32079124', '34727024', '37334142', '33039788', '29225555', '34025905', '34846751', '33477802', '36511778', '35773266', '34201195', '34242162', '34828188', '37656642', '33525619', '32429341', '34388096', '36190616', '32870791', '32878209', '37768910', '34506549', '32230961', '33171831', '32876562', '36826954', '30932832', '35036529', '37367468', '33048678', '32070999', '31919373', '33018072', '31579391', '37531306', '34770662', '34695960', '35327935', '35198987', '35250359', '29867687', '37230247', '24358389', '37056428', '34206768', '33540786', '33171831', '31905746', '29990193', '31002188', '31266251', '32030665', '34364792', '31905746', '29990193', '31002188', '31266251', '35891011', '30031932', '31266251', '29990193', '29641396', '29225555', '22248633', '18579945', '15747791', '31905746', '32030665', '34364792', '32079124', '31905746', '32030665', '34364792', '32079124']"
Automatic digital ECG signal extraction and normal QRS recognition from real scene ECG images.,"Wang, Shuang; Zhang, Shugang; Li, Zhen; Huang, Lei; Wei, Zhiqiang",2019-11-30,"Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most important tools for assessing cardiac function and detecting potential heart problems. However, most of the current ECG report records remain on the paper, which makes it difficult to preserve and analyze the data. Moreover, paper records could result in the loss significant data, which brings inconvenience to the subsequent clinical diagnosis or artificial intelligence-assisted heart health diagnosis. Taking digital pictures is an intuitive way of preserving these files and can be done simply using smartphones or any other devices with cameras. However, these real scene ECG images often have some image noise that hinders signal extraction. How to eliminate image noise and extract ECG binary image automatically from the noisy and low-quality real scene images of ECG reports is the first problem to be solved in this paper. Next, QRS recognition is implemented on the extracted binary images to determine key points of ECG signals. 1D digital ECG signal is also extracted for accessing the exact values of the extracted points.

Automated Surgical Term Clustering: A Text Mining Approach for Unstructured Textual Surgery Descriptions.,"Khaleghi, Tannaz; Murat, Alper; Arslanturk, Suzan; Davies, Eric",2019-12-02,"High costs in health care and everlasting need for quality improvement in care delivery is increasingly becoming the motivating factor for novel predictive studies in health care informatics. Surgical services impact both the operating theatre costs and revenues and play critical role in care quality. Efficiency of such units relies extremely on effective operational planning and inventory management. A key ingredient to such planning activities is the structured and unstructured data available prior to the surgery day from the electronic health records and other information systems. Unstructured data, such as textual features of procedure description and notes, provide additional information while structured data alone is not sufficient. To effectively utilize textual information using text mining, textual features should be easily identifiable, i.e., without typographical errors and ad hoc abbreviations. While there exists numerous spelling correction and abbreviation identification tools, they are not suitable for the surgical medical text as they require a dictionary and cannot accommodate ad hoc words such as abbreviations. This study proposes a novel preprocessing framework for surgical text data to detect misspellings and abbreviations prior to the application of any text mining and predictive modeling. The proposed approach helps extract the most salient text features from the unstructured principal procedure and additional notes by effectively reducing the raw feature set dimension. The transformed (text) feature set thus improves subsequent prediction tasks in surgery units. We test and validate the proposed approach using datasets from multiple hospitals' surgical departments and benchmark feature sets.",31796420,10.1109/JBHI.2019.2956973,pubmed,Journal Article,No keywords,"Algorithms; Cluster Analysis; Data Mining; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Operating Rooms; Surgical Procedures, Operative; Terminology as Topic","['31796420', '30206813', '32105569', '27165558', '30445220', '31258980', '23323800', '29849998', '29295176', '28423790', '28830417', '26063255', '26319542', '30337069', '29854154', '22464046', '27177941', '27332355', '37673570', '32702841', '29801178', '34814905', '31473365', '30661637', '29906584', '30848457', '28414821', '32525869', '33121479', '28241931', '36225163', '31166975', '32142458', '15714636', '38222369', '31834905', '26047637', '31184919', '20348557', '33616536', '24406258', '31541973', '28585184', '29702574', '27896978', '26826453', '35820793', '26316458', '24788272', '21924593', '27342107', '26210360', '31117932', '25991279', '30694223', '26184780', '31706228', '25746391', '25539500', '28495342', '26063258', '26456569', '27933738', '25980019', '31027723', '29981491', '25122604', '24788260', '25747340', '31943012', '25488240', '36563029', '31103549', '30376768', '32532784', '29972595', '27807747', '22874189', '24485708', '22665627', '34465177', '27057545', '25451103', '30016815', '30346297', '12761055', '25862765', '29753874', '25350106', '27127895', '27580980', '20876938', '28157556', '27295093', '24788270', '26099853', '19267032', '23424141', '38301515', '21901084', '33320803', '37945618', '33831055', '21059237', '33936492', '22970696', '37939098', '34457160', '32410533', '22742938', '35101128', '25131635', '36399376', '36682740', '36143144', '35042703', '35445441', '32592755', '37044558', '33539416', '35578652', '24312478', '22741525', '34013029', '37927372', '23304306', '24498398', '33044316', '36506381', '37685473', '31797592', '34065721', '37361128', '37786783', '37960458', '22541596', '37038542', '21552455', '34920473', '38198109', '30543346', '31790539', '28241257', '29955813', '35695887', '36374227', '34814905', '31796420', '30206813', '32105569', '27165558', '30445220', '29849998', '31796420', '30206813', '32105569', '27165558', '30445220', '31258980', '31796420', '27165558', '29849998', '24788272', '25991279', '26184780', '24788260', '27807747', '34465177', '24788270', '36143144', '36506381', '31796420', '27165558', '29849998', '24788272', '25991279', '26184780']"
MR-Forest: A Deep Decision Framework for False Positive Reduction in Pulmonary Nodule Detection.,"Zhu, Hongbo; Zhao, Hai; Song, Chunhe; Bian, Zijian; Bi, Yuanguo; Liu, Tong; He, Xuan; Yang, Dongxiang; Cai, Wei",2019-10-15,"With the development of deep learning methods such as convolutional neural network (CNN), the accuracy of automated pulmonary nodule detection has been greatly improved. However, the high computational and storage costs of the large-scale network have been a potential concern for the future widespread clinical application. In this paper, an alternative Multi-ringed (MR)-Forest framework, against the resource-consuming neural networks (NN)-based architectures, has been proposed for false positive reduction in pulmonary nodule detection, which consists of three steps. First, a novel multi-ringed scanning method is used to extract the order ring facets (ORFs) from the surface voxels of the volumetric nodule models; Second, Mesh-LBP and mapping deformation are employed to estimate the texture and shape features. By sliding and resampling the multi-ringed ORFs, feature volumes with different lengths are generated. Finally, the outputs of multi-level are cascaded to predict the candidate class. On 1034 scans merging the dataset from the Affiliated Hospital of Liaoning University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (AH-LUTCM) and the LUNA16 Challenge dataset, our framework performs enough competitiveness than state-of-the-art in false positive reduction task (CPM score of 0.865). Experimental results demonstrate that MR-Forest is a successful solution to satisfy both resource-consuming and effectiveness for automated pulmonary nodule detection. The proposed MR-forest is a general architecture for 3D target detection, it can be easily extended in many other medical imaging analysis tasks, where the growth trend of the targeting object is approximated as a spheroidal expansion.",31634145,10.1109/JBHI.2019.2947506,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,"Decision Trees; Deep Learning; Diagnostic Errors; Humans; Multiple Pulmonary Nodules; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Solitary Pulmonary Nodule; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","['31634145', '28113302', '31299053', '30337076', '34449037', '30137371', '36544067', '30390571', '36590762', '30452432', '35092608', '33836449', '30909118', '31003034', '36576169', '36587571', '26955024', '28732268', '32698172', '35087078', '31028657', '30863524', '31425026', '33411741', '34847048', '31521323', '32738913', '37216265', '37344565', '30954678', '12906178', '31227682', '31466261', '37833636', '32030769', '28169141', '28070212', '37368121', '31865281', '26221705', '32845877', '35984795', '26443601', '31202567', '30418929', '32095944', '29047033', '32239521', '32597085', '31714194', '30575046', '31768885', '33685584', '32592003', '30524071', '29500816', '30415720', '31875384', '28113928', '35809770', '30803208', '30334786', '30854457', '29154123', '25791434', '33081662', '35523553', '32140870', '30719445', '30670024', '20346728', '29903476', '31623996', '37451250', '29492880', '26089968', '31352126', '36433541', '38237183', '31396974', '31732411', '31141794', '29903641', '15822807', '29366586', '16898434', '30536611', '26458112', '16685910', '31025248', '20426175', '29571809', '16193773', '26405880', '33636420', '29903487', '27440183', '32752225', '28409834', '17524617', '25995695', '30251934', '26055544', '25226989', '32452736', '31020576', '26652979', '24418073', '17388179', '25303113', '31210613', '27752930', '35180709', '36401972', '36359503', '34906365', '35103029', '32658741', '37492669', '34916045', '31675322', '33141600', '33471772', '33556028', '37028322', '35009802', '36257825', '37492669', '37248730', '35342282', '31634145', '28113302', '31299053', '30337076', '34449037', '31202567', '31634145', '28113302', '31299053', '30337076', '34449037', '30137371', '31634145', '34449037', '31202567', '29047033', '31441270', '26652979', '35180709', '31634145', '34449037', '31202567', '29047033', '31441270', '26652979']"
A two-stage deep learning approach for extracting entities and relationships from medical texts.,"Suárez-Paniagua, Víctor; Rivera Zavala, Renzo M; Segura-Bedmar, Isabel; Martínez, Paloma",2019-09-20,"This work presents a two-stage deep learning system for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) from medical texts. These tasks are a crucial step to many natural language understanding applications in the biomedical domain. Automatic medical coding of electronic medical records, automated summarizing of patient records, automatic cohort identification for clinical studies, text simplification of health documents for patients, early detection of adverse drug reactions or automatic identification of risk factors are only a few examples of the many possible opportunities that the text analysis can offer in the clinical domain. In this work, our efforts are primarily directed towards the improvement of the pharmacovigilance process by the automatic detection of drug-drug interactions (DDI) from texts. Moreover, we deal with the semantic analysis of texts containing health information for patients. Our two-stage approach is based on Deep Learning architectures. Concretely, NER is performed combining a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and a Conditional Random Field (CRF), while RE applies a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Since our approach uses very few language resources, only the pre-trained word embeddings, and does not exploit any domain resources (such as dictionaries or ontologies), this can be easily expandable to support other languages and clinical applications that require the exploitation of semantic information (concepts and relationships) from texts. During the last years, the task of DDI extraction has received great attention by the BioNLP community. However, the problem has been traditionally evaluated as two separate subtasks: drug name recognition and extraction of DDIs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides an evaluation of the whole pipeline. Moreover, our system obtains state-of-the-art results on the eHealth-KD challenge, which was part of the Workshop on Semantic Analysis at SEPLN (TASS-2018).",31546016,10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103285,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Deep learning; Health documents; Name entity recognition; Relation extraction,Clinical

Chinese clinical named entity recognition with radical-level feature and self-attention mechanism.,"Yin, Mingwang; Mou, Chengjie; Xiong, Kaineng; Ren, Jiangtao",2019-09-18,"Named entity recognition is a fundamental and crucial task in medical natural language processing problems. In medical fields, Chinese clinical named entity recognition identifies boundaries and types of medical entities from unstructured text such as electronic medical records. Recently, a composition model of bidirectional Long Short-term Memory Networks (BiLSTMs) and conditional random field (BiLSTM-CRF) based character-level semantics has achieved great success in Chinese clinical named entity recognition tasks. But this method can only capture contextual semantics between characters in sentences. However, Chinese characters are hieroglyphics, and deeper semantic information is hidden inside, the BiLSTM-CRF model failed to get this information. In addition, some of the entities in the sentence are dependent, but the Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) does not capture long-term dependencies perfectly between characters. So we propose a BiLSTM-CRF model based on the radical-level feature and self-attention mechanism to solve these problems. We use the convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract radical-level features, aims to capture the intrinsic and internal relevances of characters. In addition, we use self-attention mechanism to capture the dependency between characters regardless of their distance. Experiments show that our model achieves F1-score 93.00% and 86.34% on CCKS-2017 and TP_CNER dataset respectively.",31541715,10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103289,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support,

Towards a characterization of apparent contradictions in the biomedical literature using context analysis.,"Rosemblat, Graciela; Fiszman, Marcelo; Shin, Dongwook; Kilicoglu, Halil",2019-08-29,"With the substantial growth in the biomedical research literature, a larger number of claims are published daily, some of which seemingly disagree with or contradict prior claims on the same topics. Resolving such contradictions is critical to advancing our understanding of human disease and developing effective treatments. Automated text analysis techniques can facilitate such analysis by extracting claims from the literature, flagging those that are potentially contradictory, and identifying any study characteristics that may explain such contradictions.",31473364,10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103275,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural",Biomedical research literature; Contradictions; Natural language processing; Semantic relations,Biomedical Research; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Natural Language Processing; PubMed; Publications; Reproducibility of Results; Semantics,"['31473364', '28678823', '32343247', '23044550', '32410573', '27016698', '30545491', '33612884', '27107438', '16762065', '29763706', '28284761', '27577489', '30200874', '25661592', '30217670', '26958228', '27267226', '28673289', '33936418', '22195220', '34390853', '21789201', '30975071', '29195709', '23026233', '32810207', '36933632', '26423616', '17238361', '25925131', '14728170', '25592675', '24551423', '23347886', '31676460', '18999127', '23819261', '29589569', '26323337', '30066655', '30545485', '25066773', '33317512', '15728115', '15826357', '28938912', '16580973', '19900574', '32823319', '21752612', '14759819', '26293867', '16212773', '28552401', '30400805', '25948699', '17946334', '27216254', '18999227', '24551389', '26925515', '18487828', '17134478', '26262393', '26774763', '36083212', '37930897', '29935347', '33760855', '15542023', '15651899', '31334227', '37852347', '23867104', '22195216', '21094696', '36442443', '31589927', '35817308', '32151769', '11825149', '35536289', '28302519', '20351860', '24551329', '26262109', '31980104', '27080229', '17650333', '21619603', '21347108', '23742159', '28257498', '22841748', '24260124', '37316100', '34411707', '24448204', '37290540', '36526439', '22759462', '24348899', '32249306', '20351919', '37682956', '32993795', '35877798', '29718377', '18693836', '22195132', '23937724', '34042671', '36281827', '36918777', '19527520', '31805934', '28633401', '21346999', '34794473', '24311971', '35039972', '32819419', '35863206', '31032839', '30740594', '18693787', '35308964', '34025086', '37270143', '37161227', '30616688', '37448622', '38168218', '34164753', '34479397', '19774228', '37203667', '33882597', '33564698', '22166672', '32448909', '35308948', '20700455', '24788266', '34910747', '34457183', '23645987', '36073494', '38269886', '37663348', '31347033', '33275867', '37323614', '18311168', '37105245', '34714970', '23046748', '20618983', '38244957', '32525206', '37758905', '37934761', '22166304', '33307747', '18735805', '33678940', '32412547', '34975190', '36488343', '37136624', '37485855', '37463697', '37775139', '36508075', '37268776', '18629239', '23264856', '37135367', '33571675', '37086959', '36933632', '35817308', '32823319', '32410573', '32343247', '31473364', '28678823', '32343247', '23044550', '32823319', '15826357', '31473364', '28678823', '32343247', '23044550', '32410573', '27016698', '30158069', '29271976', '28678823', '28633401', '27267226', '26851224', '26306241', '26261718', '26073888', '25588314', '23044550', '22759461', '22621266', '21985429', '20442139', '19900574', '18056905', '16779117', '16368768', '16014596', '15878467', '14759819', '14681409', '10639540', '8622332', '31473364', '32823319', '15826357', '28938912', '16580973', '26293867', '16212773', '17134478', '31589927', '35817308', '35863206', '34479397', '24788266', '32228359', '31473364', '32823319', '15826357', '28938912', '16580973', '26293867']"
ETL Framework for Real-Time Business Intelligence over Medical Imaging Repositories.,"Godinho, Tiago Marques; Lebre, Rui; Almeida, João Rafael; Costa, Carlos",No date,"In the last decades, the amount of medical imaging studies and associated metadata has been rapidly increasing. Despite being mostly used for supporting medical diagnosis and treatment, many recent initiatives claim the use of medical imaging studies in clinical research scenarios but also to improve the business practices of medical institutions. However, the continuous production of medical imaging studies coupled with the tremendous amount of associated data, makes the real-time analysis of medical imaging repositories difficult using conventional tools and methodologies. Those archives contain not only the image data itself but also a wide range of valuable metadata describing all the stakeholders involved in the examination. The exploration of such technologies will increase the efficiency and quality of medical practice. In major centers, it represents a big data scenario where Business Intelligence (BI) and Data Analytics (DA) are rare and implemented through data warehousing approaches. This article proposes an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) framework for medical imaging repositories able to feed, in real-time, a developed BI (Business Intelligence) application. The solution was designed to provide the necessary environment for leading research on top of live institutional repositories without requesting the creation of a data warehouse. It features an extensible dashboard with customizable charts and reports, with an intuitive web-based interface that empowers the usage of novel data mining techniques, namely, a variety of data cleansing tools, filters, and clustering functions.

Medical assertion classification in Chinese EMRs using attention enhanced neural network.,"Zhang, Zhi Chang; Zhang, Yu; Zhou, Tong; Pang, Ya Li",No date,"Electronic medical records (EMRs), such as hospital discharge summaries, contain a wealth of information only expressed in natural language. Automated methods for extracting information from these records must be able to recognize medical concepts in text and their semantic context. A contextual property critical to reason on information from EMRs is the doctor's belief status or assertion of the patient's medical problem. Research on the medical assertion classification (MAC) can establish the foundation for various health data analyses and clinical applications. However, previous MAC studies are mainly based on traditional machine learning methods which mostly require manually constructed features and the original unlabeled data cannot be easily and effectively applied to classification or classification tasks. Furthermore, external medical knowledge such as various medical dictionary bases, which provides rich explain and definition information about medical entity, is rarely utilized in existing neural network models of medical information extraction. In this study, we propose a deep neural network architecture enhanced by medical knowledge attention layer through combining GRU neural network with CNN model to classify the assertion type of medical problem such as disease and symptom in Chinese EMRs. The attention layer in the model is applied to integrate entity representations learned from medical dictionary bases as query for encoding. Experimental results on own manually annotated corpus indicate our approach achieves better performance compared to existing methods.",31137195,10.3934/mbe.2019096,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't", Chinese electronic medical record ;  attention mechanism ;  deep learning ;  medical entity assertion classification ,"China; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Language; Machine Learning; Medical Informatics; Neural Networks, Computer","['31137195', '31801540', '30961580', '30700331', '32131522', '30709336', '35321705', '37163343', '30961622', '32364514', '30961596', '32109551', '31838210', '31541715', '30946674', '33711543', '28699566', '30902121', '29109070', '34330253', '38007808', '35761319', '31851906', '29643524', '31627032', '32503424', '30943972', '37488521', '31164204', '29778673', '30336262', '29297414', '31470094', '30266231', '38303468', '35217186', '30591015', '31437912', '30818005', '32828460', '30700301', '33970113', '30292854', '30943960', '32143787', '35430042', '32987500', '28034407', '30777618', '33737207', '32646495', '29025149', '26262126', '34972505', '32885786', '36032005', '29854183', '31557528', '30961587', '35769283', '32749976', '34723829', '36038067', '31557530', '32987540', '28391811', '29191207', '30961597', '29679019', '29801696', '31577448', '31319942', '31467518', '35969556', '31541881', '24486562', '30399432', '32396105', '32353595', '29994157', '26481140', '29887232', '21685143', '37817193', '29666671', '32859189', '31627021', '29671399', '32783631', '37316096', '31647443', '33930566', '30017973', '29428070', '35428175', '32819377', '35878823', '32295174', '29994540', '31717300', '30784428', '31396271', '30768971', '32448122', '33893606', '28606869', '36241999', '29271009', '21553535', '28958803', '31765318', '31842854', '29935347', '35928762', '35240782', '29966746', '31499354', '31200909', '30026067', '30048461', '24070769', '31996705', '26295801', '28423791', '29928997', '35811026', '29447188', '36060867', '30864307', '31200912', '33346740', '34330264', '29029598', '31881965', '32413094', '31445256', '30815095', '33757172', '31202398', '27501231', '34455090', '30142385', '32590229', '31425047', '31568842', '35193692', '32646437', '29589571', '32169670', '34180203', '32673791', '18952931', '31592533', '26783204', '31236107', '31315754', '34116253', '29903491', '35651926', '32298846', '37276755', '29135365', '33781918', '28268855', '29175431', '31125403', '30961614', '34125076', '34741890', '34119692', '32143785', '30969930', '36031980', '37203496', '34971981', '36478240', '37501492', '32570656', '37566468', '34961490', '32454243', '37295630', '28663163', '24556644', '33258777', '32783923', '31945959', '36788504', '36928266', '30815184', '32570411', '35603381', '32143789', '32831820', '34202713', '32952544', '36032011', '34029829', '30296210', '31438212', '33372606', '35938002', '38083156', '31991649', '33026359', '36164586', '36862711', '37203504', '33323114', '36536291', '27478379', '36747060', '32446958', '30870615', '31933621', '36777631', '31797591', '32693245', '33080458', '36330405', '32646430', '32750951', '37506054', '31107679', '38261481', '36073468', '33019310', '31902775', '34457173', '36670382', '31216289', '36276852', '32421707', '38337845', '22084813', '37059736', '34636543', '33679271', '25285329', '30306147', '37910899', '38042599', '36865787', '34128811', '31137195', '31801540', '30709336', '30961580', '31557530', '31945959', '31137195', '31801540', '30961580', '30700331', '32131522', '30709336', '31137195', '31557530', '31945959', '32952544', '30870615', '31137195', '31557530', '31945959', '32952544', '30870615']"

Currently, there are a number of computer systems that allow the user to reconstruct molecular-genetic networks using the data automatically extracted from the texts of scientific publications. Examples of such systems are STRING, Pathway Commons, MetaCore and Ingenuity. The MetaCore and Ingenuity systems permit taking into account tissue-specific gene expression during the reconstruction of gene networks. Previously, we developed the ANDSystem tool, which also provides an automated extraction of knowledge from scientific texts and allows the reconstruction of gene networks. The main difference between our system and other tools is in the different types of interactions between objects, which makes the ANDSystem complementary to existing well-known systems.

Spatio-Temporal Features in Action Recognition Using 3D Skeletal Joints.,"Trăscău, Mihai; Nan, Mihai; Florea, Adina Magda",2019-01-21,"Robust action recognition methods lie at the cornerstone of Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems employing optical devices. Using 3D skeleton joints extracted from depth images taken with time-of-flight (ToF) cameras has been a popular solution for accomplishing these tasks. Though seemingly scarce in terms of information availability compared to its RGB or depth image counterparts, the skeletal representation has proven to be effective in the task of action recognition. This paper explores different interpretations of both the spatial and the temporal dimensions of a sequence of frames describing an action. We show that rather intuitive approaches, often borrowed from other computer vision tasks, can improve accuracy. We report results based on these modifications and propose an architecture that uses temporal convolutions with results comparable to the state of the art.",30669628,10.3390/s19020423,pubmed,Journal Article,AAL; AmI; action recognition,"Algorithms; Bone and Bones; Databases as Topic; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Joints; Movement; Neural Networks, Computer; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Time Factors","['30669628', '35361804', '29870355', '22392705', '32932774', '33481706', '30908224', '33946998', '33471763', '26230696', '32438776', '34614809', '31022945', '37299986', '33351768', '25473850', '34201991', '26353226', '29671746', '32517141', '29877439', '32468527', '16468626', '36679576', '33502972', '36146186', '29324413', '32942579', '35733557', '26955020', '24184728', '23912503', '34502783', '20714014', '30530311', '25216492', '32224465', '19299856', '32575802', '16566510', '34450781', '26751452', '25546860', '32726285', '30818796', '32575708', '29570086', '31234366', '34456989', '35336262', '15567530', '33914681', '16724585', '33540809', '23807686', '34506281', '32672242', '36772770', '32825038', '37335800', '25942404', '35260760', '33803929', '19029553', '15484913', '24945679', '16640261', '32218350', '20084664', '16366253', '8331995', '23893725', '37299848', '18002092', '34695972', '31936089', '28733975', '37420759', '16402618', '31095476', '30376567', '32054587', '26353312', '36904953', '24577192', '21808084', '35047028', '32305901', '27071176', '27069469', '16402630', '30872245', '30835222', '26270909', '22745001', '34840561', '36121957', '33803929', '33352943', '33171709', '30669628', '22392705', '29870355', '32932774', '15567530', '26751452', '30669628', '35361804', '29870355', '22392705', '32932774', '33481706', '31722488', '29990167', '28391189', '28026749', '30669628', '15567530', '26751452', '30818796', '36850778', '34205782', '30669628', '15567530', '26751452', '30818796', '36850778', '34205782']"
BioCreative VI Precision Medicine Track system performance is constrained by entity recognition and variations in corpus characteristics.,"Chen, Qingyu; Panyam, Nagesh C; Elangovan, Aparna; Verspoor, Karin",2018-01-01,"Precision medicine aims to provide personalized treatments based on individual patient profiles. One critical step towards precision medicine is leveraging knowledge derived from biomedical publications-a tremendous literature resource presenting the latest scientific discoveries on genes, mutations and diseases. Biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) plays a vital role in supporting automation of this process. BioCreative VI Track 4 brings community effort to the task of automatically identifying and extracting protein-protein interactions (PPi) affected by mutations (PPIm), important in the precision medicine context for capturing individual genotype variation related to disease.We present the READ-BioMed team's approach to identifying PPIm-related publications and to extracting specific PPIm information from those publications in the context of the BioCreative VI PPIm track. We observe that current BioNLP tools are insufficient to recognise entities for these two tasks; the best existing mutation recognition tool achieves only 55% recall in the document triage training set, while relation extraction performance is limited by the low recall performance of gene entity recognition. We develop the models accordingly: for document triage, we develop term lists capturing interactions and mutations to complement BioNLP tools, and select effective features via a feature contribution study, whereas an ensemble of BioNLP tools is employed for relation extraction.Our best document triage model achieves an F-score of 66.77% while our best model for relation extraction achieved an F-score of 35.09% over the final (updated post-task) test set. Impacting the document triage task, the characteristics of mutations are statistically different in the training and testing sets. While a vital new direction for biomedical text mining research, this early attempt to tackle the problem of identifying genetic variation of substantial biological significance highlights the importance of representative training data and the cascading impact of tool limitations in a modular system.",30576491,10.1093/database/bay122,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,Biomedical Research; Data Mining; Humans; Medical Informatics; Mutation; Natural Language Processing; Precision Medicine,"['30576491', '30689846', '25149151', '33167858', '26994911', '30295718', '36882099', '34789238', '22151823', '31200912', '30624649', '30367569', '30961584', '18834487', '26201352', '27902695', '30296491', '23180769', '22151968', '28316651', '27161011', '22151647', '27216254', '30874918', '30239680', '26047637', '27454860', '31301513', '29954318', '35856889', '35448946', '24800214', '30631966', '29763706', '24919658', '27087307', '27127603', '37682321', '24212118', '35962559', '33885370', '19958517', '26043907', '23221174', '27173520', '29122011', '25935162', '20671316', '22759456', '19232400', '26187250', '29935347', '31550346', '29029598', '36458799', '37632414', '18834500', '26201478', '32216746', '38015956', '28365720', '18433469', '25036529', '22239956', '28968638', '23613763', '27121612', '27554092', '35379166', '26045232', '27052618', '24060600', '16504116', '21508414', '22901054', '31603193', '20498514', '26925515', '23396322', '29382397', '30010731', '36197453', '19535010', '23954592', '31568842', '24393765', '30137284', '30296207', '29746916', '29601989', '34398194', '25909637', '27542845', '30020437', '30616557', '26357317', '28622674', '19735740', '36781035', '27175227', '28359255', '31796060', '34457142', '37914988', '38012982', '30576487', '37673376', '37502629', '32770181', '38269887', '30519990', '26202570', '32422651', '35331131', '38274947', '38011170', '25214883', '31032839', '24454579', '38269886', '35441084', '31307133', '37580461', '34983371', '31035936', '30576491', '30689846', '25149151', '30295718', '25935162', '19957157', '30576491', '30689846', '25149151', '33167858', '26994911', '30295718', '30585742', '29762787', '28968638', '28818042', '28031747', '27980099', '27902695', '27374122', '27256315', '26941831', '26380306', '26094768', '26017442', '26014593', '25635347', '25285203', '24136999', '23703206', '23613763', '23584833', '23160416', '23160414', '23046792', '22513129', '22199390', '22121220', '21138947', '20671319', '20485264', '19435614', '17495998', '11238071', '9377276', '30576491', '25935162', '19957157', '32770181', '32422651', '25214883', '24788266', '32382319', '30576491', '25935162', '19957157', '32770181', '32422651', '25214883']"
Fully convolutional multi-scale residual DenseNets for cardiac segmentation and automated cardiac diagnosis using ensemble of classifiers.,"Khened, Mahendra; Kollerathu, Varghese Alex; Krishnamurthi, Ganapathy",2018-10-19,"Deep fully convolutional neural network (FCN) based architectures have shown great potential in medical image segmentation. However, such architectures usually have millions of parameters and inadequate number of training samples leading to over-fitting and poor generalization. In this paper, we present a novel DenseNet based FCN architecture for cardiac segmentation which is parameter and memory efficient. We propose a novel up-sampling path which incorporates long skip and short-cut connections to overcome the feature map explosion in conventional FCN based architectures. In order to process the input images at multiple scales and view points simultaneously, we propose to incorporate Inception module's parallel structures. We propose a novel dual loss function whose weighting scheme allows to combine advantages of cross-entropy and Dice loss leading to qualitative improvements in segmentation. We demonstrate computational efficacy of incorporating conventional computer vision techniques for region of interest detection in an end-to-end deep learning based segmentation framework. From the segmentation maps we extract clinically relevant cardiac parameters and hand-craft features which reflect the clinical diagnostic analysis and train an ensemble system for cardiac disease classification. We validate our proposed network architecture on three publicly available datasets, namely: (i) Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC-2017), (ii) Left Ventricular segmentation challenge (LV-2011), (iii) 2015 Kaggle Data Science Bowl cardiac challenge data. Our approach in ACDC-2017 challenge stood second place for segmentation and first place in automated cardiac disease diagnosis tasks with an accuracy of 100% on a limited testing set (n=50). In the LV-2011 challenge our approach attained 0.74 Jaccard index, which is so far the highest published result in fully automated algorithms. In the Kaggle challenge our approach for LV volume gave a Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) of 0.0127, which would have placed us tenth in the original challenge. Our approach combined both cardiac segmentation and disease diagnosis into a fully automated framework which is computationally efficient and hence has the potential to be incorporated in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools for clinical application.",30390512,10.1016/j.media.2018.10.004,pubmed,Journal Article,Automated diagnosis; Cardiac MRI; Deep learning; Ensemble classifier; Fully

Local Binary Patterns Descriptor Based on Sparse Curvelet Coefficients for False-Positive Reduction in Mammograms.,"Pawar, Meenakshi M; Talbar, Sanjay N; Dudhane, Akshay",2018-09-25,"Breast Cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women across the globe. Automatic detection of breast cancer using Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system suffers from false positives (FPs). Thus, reduction of FP is one of the challenging tasks to improve the performance of the diagnosis systems. In the present work, new FP reduction technique has been proposed for breast cancer diagnosis. It is based on appropriate integration of preprocessing, Self-organizing map (SOM) clustering, region of interest (ROI) extraction, and FP reduction. In preprocessing, contrast enhancement of mammograms has been achieved using Local Entropy Maximization algorithm. The unsupervised SOM clusters an image into number of segments to identify the cancerous region and extracts tumor regions (i.e., ROIs). However, it also detects some FPs which affects the efficiency of the algorithm. Therefore, to reduce the FPs, the output of the SOM is given to the FP reduction step which is aimed to classify the extracted ROIs into normal and abnormal class. FP reduction consists of feature mining from the ROIs using proposed local sparse curvelet coefficients followed by classification using artificial neural network (ANN). The performance of proposed algorithm has been validated using the local datasets as TMCH (Tata Memorial Cancer Hospital) and publicly available MIAS (Suckling et al., 1994) and DDSM (Heath et al., 2000) database. The proposed technique results in reduction of FPs from 0.85 to 0.02 FP/image for MIAS, 4.81 to 0.16 FP/image for DDSM, and 2.32 to 0.05 FP/image for TMCH reflecting huge improvement in classification of mammograms.",30356422,10.1155/2018/5940436,pubmed,Journal Article,No keywords,"Algorithms; Biopsy; Breast; Breast Neoplasms; Cluster Analysis; Databases, Factual; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; False Positive Reactions; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Mammography; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Sensitivity and Specificity; Software","['30356422', '16964876', '29428071', '17879797', '27908154', '30661242', '29728249', '28391823', '18777923', '25795630', '26151831', '29582242', '30119844', '19928076', '24923292', '9198026', '19291970', '16964885', '19175093', '17153394', '28549292', '20127270', '17264365', '28603939', '26133587', '11811822', '9365751', '23053352', '31985483', '11243350', '17089857', '35916103', '21448711', '25544726', '8551980', '22234836', '19163345', '24961885', '21554985', '31515007', '16266097', '18358699', '18383691', '15587648', '29691123', '25086535', '8860907', '12542239', '18003291', '12906196', '15000617', '17441235', '10501064', '24110967', '17502255', '28127383', '15104319', '15551553', '22460365', '16898468', '18051070', '24518702', '26206406', '17089846', '16898462', '17654922', '30256567', '29055935', '11438784', '24506622', '15543797', '15125150', '21669471', '18423320', '27847817', '23054747', '30963339', '25226989', '29854359', '26409521', '9650186', '26831269', '12356499', '35027940', '24564973', '21992380', '20540910', '23273502', '25005867', '29143395', '28622679', '21956492', '32790772', '20004076', '31306148', '31450903', '30197344', '19163784', '32300474', '21844845', '30856154', '31233970', '25571033', '24330643', '25277539', '19964312', '33193807', '21380554', '34300597', '21947904', '34374941', '19816741', '23305491', '17946650', '32297129', '21748410', '31467326', '30771549', '33982807', '25037713', '17505872', '36766453', '34384204', '20703733', '34790252', '32007838', '24764773', '31525547', '37919992', '35053013', '36462904', '21725620', '32658733', '36188701', '22006275', '23580025', '29097047', '32723235', '34061371', '28269153', '31254729', '31421868', '36646021', '33919623', '21476083', '32554139', '36792720', '22784625', '25298929', '31915519', '37712226', '33580463', '33979759', '24324523', '26737917', '32480189', '35726812', '20033599', '34763806', '35204646', '31722327', '24414539', '32873872', '19964909', '29060098', '20686927', '26736212', '34753080', '29065592', '27187600', '26736839', '35083334', '17271923', '33882475', '24771118', '33818716', '26609404', '29893330', '32479347', '36563539', '33504312', '24110527', '33018186', '17281764', '17272054', '24367393', '24942983', '33404910', '35491993', '29060223', '23298099', '31946921', '24659445', '33371857', '35135226', '32287004', '31799718', '23365556', '33073255', '24111447', '20703746', '33674636', '36428538', '34326868', '24954976', '37857643', '36650301', '33179194', '34549660', '24110523', '33845408', '31947455', '32436139', '34239550', '31234363', '28269122', '30666854', '23165041', '19162603', '34460472', '25570357', '32768050', '36373132', '24110537', '19369162', '30405708', '29322559', '25570469', '32828443', '28216571', '19163366', '35036353', '32561410', '32908472', '22256141', '17272050', '17281226', '32991962', '25505753', '34777384', '26430470', '17272000', '31947459', '34207226', '17282952', '24839352', '35853014', '24737307', '30113824', '34329158', '35621892', '32984498', '17280972', '31258983', '30356422', '16964876', '29428071', '17879797', '21448711', '32300474', '30356422', '16964876', '29428071', '17879797', '27908154', '30661242', '28391823', '28279861', '28181405', '27015322', '26232859', '26151831', '25795630', '25544726', '24954976', '24513228', '24286729', '23668353', '23273502', '23270962', '23247864', '22115076', '21669471', '20163793', '20071209', '20004076', '19406614', '30356422', '21448711', '32300474', '36646021', '36563539', '33371857', '34860316', '34207226', '30356422', '21448711', '32300474', '36646021', '36563539', '33371857']"
Anatomical Landmark Based Deep Feature Representation for MR Images in Brain Disease Diagnosis.,"Liu, Mingxia; Zhang, Jun; Nie, Dong; Yap, Pew-Thian; Shen, Dinggang",2018-01-10,"Most automated techniques for brain disease diagnosis utilize hand-crafted (e.g., voxel-based or region-based) biomarkers from structural magnetic resonance (MR) images as feature representations. However, these hand-crafted features are usually high-dimensional or require regions-of-interest defined by experts. Also, because of possibly heterogeneous property between the hand-crafted features and the subsequent model, existing methods may lead to sub-optimal performances in brain disease diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a landmark-based deep feature learning (LDFL) framework to automatically extract patch-based representation from MRI for automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. We first identify discriminative anatomical landmarks from MR images in a data-driven manner, and then propose a convolutional neural network for patch-based deep feature learning. We have evaluated the proposed method on subjects from three public datasets, including the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI-1), ADNI-2, and the minimal interval resonance imaging in alzheimer's disease (MIRIAD) dataset. Experimental results of both tasks of brain disease classification and MR image retrieval demonstrate that the proposed LDFL method improves the performance of disease classification and MR image retrieval.",29994175,10.1109/JBHI.2018.2791863,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",No keywords,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Algorithms; Anatomic Landmarks; Brain; Brain Diseases; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Neuroimaging","['29994175', '30222548', '29107865', '27333602', '28534798', '28260614', '30582529', '28114031', '30130647', '31446125', '30340094', '26069906', '26540666', '28624881', '26433614', '26742127', '26572145', '28054724', '28391822', '29702414', '28934923', '32721906', '32479504', '29031664', '27478060', '34838263', '26226415', '29756129', '31345943', '25463474', '28445774', '27776438', '32259762', '30932861', '26476928', '32746142', '31899417', '29118808', '24525169', '26254746', '27781951', '30447544', '18672421', '29582337', '32253701', '28113481', '27046891', '30892204', '37120169', '29903486', '29802968', '27632977', '26657976', '27046107', '27908163', '30281500', '34917168', '31028606', '26405887', '28167394', '25652394', '29017867', '28952940', '27273091', '29544790', '35458896', '36374874', '30326293', '28113353', '27296013', '31499667', '26276982', '25940587', '31691120', '29994324', '26886975', '27914302', '28888171', '28192624', '28850876', '27060621', '27354189', '25079801', '30908202', '26836190', '17427738', '24893256', '29454006', '34997720', '28119818', '29994627', '34156939', '28392490', '30172091', '30894334', '35785662', '30125711', '31786457', '32300361', '29956131', '31016571', '30334750', '26552069', '31563069', '32895137', '31946769', '29710748', '31175927', '17946017', '34272060', '37015464', '34732323', '29994089', '37909364', '31229667', '32960410', '30784956', '33441557', '29890408', '29702348', '31794419', '32833630', '28515009', '31021764', '31421161', '30530315', '31734325', '31802999', '35040408', '33930828', '33208302', '30606726', '28956028', '28959800', '32591831', '29881892', '29994560', '28231282', '28936489', '31144631', '30311316', '36259367', '31944968', '22821920', '34252532', '31945936', '35411565', '30498877', '30716056', '33958980', '33283214', '36346864', '32592983', '30440491', '35568346', '38113163', '38148809', '29435954', '25129841', '31603816', '34355224', '29376149', '33776639', '28207873', '35095411', '32217472', '30440621', '24235274', '36122684', '31071473', '33999826', '30223797', '38262133', '29225556', '36374873', '23382891', '33041768', '30221242', '24338727', '30932858', '36616876', '24179864', '31546048', '36034139', '30004899', '36383596', '28630885', '35324436', '32746057', '30008658', '27182122', '34128187', '34428153', '24498250', '38304005', '38148809', '37909364', '37645880', '37468538', '37189595', '35572142', '35103240', '34466399', '34330265', '34249658', '34213702', '34156939', '33313075', '33250847', '33117114', '32728983', '32217472', '32208428', '31825859', '31419815', '31329111', '29994175', '30222548', '29107865', '27333602', '28445774', '28392490', '29994175', '30222548', '29107865', '27333602', '28534798', '28260614', '29107865', '28678706', '28534798', '28371772', '27898305', '27333602', '27236221', '26742127', '26540666', '22910113', '22003753', '21281717', '21236349', '20542124', '20383319', '20139996', '19022861', '18691658', '18302232', '18202106', '16986543', '14512832', '12853571', '12575879', '12130773', '11771995', '11467904', '11352619', '11310620', '10984517', '10860804', '10811879', '10716738', '10227624', '9617910', '9530404', '6474172', '1734300', '1180967', '29994175', '28445774', '28392490', '31229667', '32960410', '35040408', '30498877', '31071473', '34428153', '29994175', '28445774', '28392490', '31229667', '32960410', '35040408']"
Deep Attention-Based Spatially Recursive Networks for Fine-Grained Visual Recognition.,"Wu, Lin; Wang, Yang; Li, Xue; Gao, Junbin",2018-03-22,"Fine-grained visual recognition is an important problem in pattern recognition applications. However, it is a challenging task due to the subtle interclass difference and large intraclass variation. Recent visual attention models are able to automatically locate critical object parts and represent them against appearance variations. However, without consideration of spatial dependencies in discriminative feature learning, these methods are underperformed in classifying fine-grained objects. In this paper, we present a deep attention-based spatially recursive model that can learn to attend to critical object parts and encode them into spatially expressive representations. Our network is technically premised on bilinear pooling, enabling local pairwise feature interactions between outputs from two different convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that correspond to distinct region detection and relevant feature extraction. Then, spatial long-short term memory (LSTMs) units are introduced to generate spatially meaningful hidden representations via the long-range dependency on all features in two dimensions. The attention model is leveraged between bilinear outcomes and spatial LSTMs for dynamic selection on varied inputs. Our model, which is composed of two-stream CNN layers, bilinear pooling, and spatial recursive encoding with attention, is end-to-end trainable to serve as the part detector and feature extractor whereby relevant features are localized, extracted, and encoded spatially for recognition purpose. We demonstrate the superiority of our method over two typical fine-grained recognition tasks: fine-grained image classification and person re-identification.",29993796,10.1109/TCYB.2018.2813971,pubmed,Journal Article,No keywords,"Algorithms; Databases, Factual; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Machine Learning; Neural

Protein Remote Homology Detection and Fold Recognition Based on Sequence-Order Frequency Matrix.,"Liu, Bin; Chen, Junjie; Guo, Mingyue; Wang, Xiaolong",2017-10-23,"Protein remote homology detection and fold recognition are two critical tasks for the studies of protein structures and functions. Currently, the profile-based methods achieve the state-of-the-art performance in these fields. However, the widely used sequence profiles, like position-specific frequency matrix (PSFM) and position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), ignore the sequence-order effects along protein sequence. In this study, we have proposed a novel profile, called sequence-order frequency matrix (SOFM), to extract the sequence-order information of neighboring residues from multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Combined with two profile feature extraction approaches, top-n-grams and the Smith-Waterman algorithm, the SOFMs are applied to protein remote homology detection and fold recognition, and two predictors called SOFM-Top and SOFM-SW are proposed. Experimental results show that SOFM contains more information content than other profiles, and these two predictors outperform other state-of-the-art methods. It is anticipated that SOFM will become a very useful profile in the studies of protein structures and functions.",29990004,10.1109/TCBB.2017.2765331,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,"Algorithms; Amino Acid Sequence; Computational Biology; Databases, Protein; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Position-Specific Scoring Matrices; Protein Folding; Proteins; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, Protein","['29990004', '18378524', '26208362', '16188929', '19046430', '17570145', '29993950', '21664609', '18590572', '16677385', '16108083', '15706505', '24675572', '24316367', '23995390', '33160906', '16317074', '24698944', '12855434', '19828575', '23609941', '18707536', '15769835', '31940548', '18245127', '16837522', '17567614', '28534783', '27881430', '32427287', '19642275', '23747746', '16020471', '21704312', '15523666', '24318998', '12386002', '16448009', '17488755', '14764565', '21301031', '17573243', '32356759', '18337259', '17237087', '18847492', '17003074', '26451830', '26269100', '27483459', '17090576', '18522726', '14734312', '27581095', '27578239', '20855926', '14630658', '11861921', '12603033', '15817691', '15562515', '26597571', '24564580', '28483566', '20689185', '19351620', '18048157', '18048179', '18076050', '17725841', '20463972', '22275069', '18803867', '15939584', '26357074', '11790846', '10698636', '27383535', '15514002', '23720362', '14696197', '18429149', '16723011', '14748004', '22000802', '20658312', '19274633', '33780341', '16960974', '28903538', '18601985', '17254344', '19426450', '11316884', '32372711', '20529920', '23029559', '24590441', '21365008', '31472418', '33971164', '21429187', '19709406', '27294123', '19995340', '11108698', '20635424', '16248799', '19478001', '33442949', '25008052', '33259717', '16522182', '20302613', '32898222', '30998480', '32750896', '35652719', '20406500', '34320027', '19055796', '16759376', '23710446', '26489143', '18398479', '37833837', '20518733', '20843957', '12127456', '24281694', '31878100', '22586462', '30668845', '19799553', '35507261', '35970053', '25080993', '11522917', '22254835', '31813954', '19091021', '30714638', '32685972', '33888741', '35439138', '35120181', '29914376', '35799660', '24164305', '35189634', '37034382', '33606823', '33537753', '32112084', '31552241', '30184176', '29990004', '18378524', '26208362', '16188929', '27881430', '17003074', '29990004', '18378524', '26208362', '16188929', '19046430', '17570145', '29990004', '27881430', '17003074', '15939584', '16248799', '30998480', '12127456', '29990004', '27881430', '17003074', '15939584', '16248799', '30998480']"
"A Review of Automated Pain Assessment in Infants: Features, Classification Tasks, and Databases.","Zamzmi, Ghada; Kasturi, Rangachar; Goldgof, Dmitry; Zhi, Ruicong; Ashmeade, Terri; Sun, Yu",2017-11-27,"Bedside caregivers assess infants' pain at constant intervals by observing specific behavioral and physiological signs of pain. This standard has two main limitations. The first limitation is the intermittent assessment of pain, which might lead to missing pain when the infants are left unattended. Second, it is inconsistent since it depends on the observer's subjective judgment and differs between observers. Intermittent and inconsistent assessment can induce poor treatment and, therefore, cause serious long-term consequences. To mitigate these limitations, the current standard can be augmented by an automated system that monitors infants continuously and provides quantitative and consistent assessment of pain. Several automated methods have been introduced to assess infants' pain automatically based on analysis of behavioral or physiological pain indicators. This paper comprehensively reviews the automated approaches (i.e., approaches to feature extraction) for analyzing infants' pain and the current efforts in automatic pain recognition. In addition, it reviews the databases available to the research community and discusses the current limitations of the automated pain assessment.",29989992,10.1109/RBME.2017.2777907,pubmed,Journal Article; Review,No keywords,"Crying; Databases, Factual; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Monitoring, Physiologic; Pain; Pain Measurement; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","['29989992', '20582383', '17964721', '12394042', '30987943', '29019634', '37331703', '27658339', '10665310', '17679584', '9732679', '19262913', '16299865', '10575922', '31094936', '23972751', '2691586', '26474712', '14605260', '29512503', '18243593', '28414516', '25929312', '4143884', '4143885', '30669130', '34599062', '16647310', '26474183', '24501869', '23036250', '15856439', '11513283', '17057556', '11404732', '21762417', '15673649', '12380468', '18840204', '27848210', '24815773', '15544980', '20096511', '24300956', '16291831', '18715388', '22929603', '25504956', '34300578', '21335865', '14768767', '16636358', '29997313', '25060331', '28724434', '2657689', '23759336', '16983586', '21283050', '19036628', '18264622', '34481767', '3633300', '32382799', '32758355', '11446213', '17273395', '35174358', '23498365', '36010186', '30987943', '30447813', '36780223', '35546868', '31653303', '38273072', '38124717', '38062194', '37821124', '37799341', '37674052', '37627921', '37571601', '37416623', '37337167', '37300019', '37146182', '36939418', '36780223', '36497838', '36010186', '35688852', '35547946', '35174358', '35161612', '33600467', '33348218', '33148327', '32952747', '32541893', '31831532', '29989992', '20582383', '17964721', '12394042', '30987943', '29019634', '29989992', '20582383', '17964721', '12394042', '30987943', '29019634', '29989992', '30987943', '29019634', '19262913', '10575922', '31094936', '23972751', '2691586', '30669130', '34599062', '16647310', '24501869', '23036250', '15856439', '11513283', '11404732', '12380468', '27848210', '15544980', '24300956', '22929603', '25504956', '2657689', '34481767', '32382799', '29989992', '30987943', '29019634', '19262913', '10575922', '31094936']"
Ordinal Pattern: A New Descriptor for Brain Connectivity Networks.,"Zhang, Daoqiang; Huang, Jiashuang; Jie, Biao; Du, Junqiang; Tu, Liyang; Liu, Mingxia",No date,"Brain connectivity networks based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or functional MRI (fMRI) data provide a straightforward way to quantify the structural or functional systems of the brain. Currently, there are several network descriptors developed for representing and analyzing brain connectivity networks. However, most of them are designed for unweighted networks, regardless of the valuable weight information of edges, or do not take advantage of the ordinal relationship of weighted edges (even though they are designed for weighted networks). In this paper, we propose a new network descriptor (i.e., ordinal pattern that contains a sequence of weighted edges) for brain connectivity network analysis. Compared with previous network properties, the proposed ordinal patterns cannot only take advantage of the weight information of edges but also explicitly model the ordinal relationship of weighted edges in brain connectivity networks. We further develop an ordinal pattern-based learning framework for brain disease diagnosis using resting-state fMRI data. Specifically, we first construct a set of brain functional connectivity networks, where each network is corresponding to a particular subject. We then develop an algorithm to identify ordinal patterns that frequently appear in brain connectivity networks of patients and normal controls. We further perform discriminative ordinal pattern selection and extract feature representations for subjects based on the selected ordinal patterns, followed by a learning model for automated brain disease diagnosis. Experimental results on both Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder-200 data sets demonstrate that our method outperforms the several state-of-the-art approaches in the tasks of disease classification and clinical score regression.",29969421,10.1109/TMI.2018.2798500,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,"Algorithms;

Fully Automatic Lesion Localization and Characterization: Application to Brain Tumors Using Multiparametric Quantitative MRI Data.,"Arnaud, Alexis; Forbes, Florence; Coquery, Nicolas; Collomb, Nora; Lemasson, Benjamin; Barbier, Emmanuel L",No date,"When analyzing brain tumors, two tasks are intrinsically linked, spatial localization, and physiological characterization of the lesioned tissues. Automated data-driven solutions exist, based on image segmentation techniques or physiological parameters analysis, but for each task separately, the other being performedmanually or with user tuning operations. In this paper, the availability of quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) parameters is combined with advancedmultivariate statistical tools to design a fully automated method that jointly performs both localization and characterization. Non trivial interactions between relevant physiologicalparameters are capturedthanks to recent generalized Student distributions that provide a larger variety of distributional shapes compared to the more standard Gaussian distributions. Probabilisticmixtures of the former distributions are then consideredto account for the different tissue types and potential heterogeneity of lesions. Discriminative multivariate features are extracted from this mixture modeling and turned into individual lesion signatures. The signatures are subsequently pooled together to build a statistical fingerprintmodel of the different lesion types that captures lesion characteristics while accounting for inter-subject variability. The potential of this generic procedure is demonstrated on a data set of 53 rats, with 36 rats bearing 4 different brain tumors, for which 5 quantitative MR parameters were acquired.",29969418,10.1109/TMI.2018.2794918,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,"Algorithms; Animals; Brain Neoplasms; Databases, Factual; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Rats","['29969418', '28472943', '28269819', '23384318', '8591302', '29049909', '25540017', '23796882', '29763764', '12472266', '26910516', '19344687', '23757180', '26106563', '26518734', '23790354', '29289703', '26057591', '24148784', '29728237', '27812502', '27417984', '21497655', '21233004', '25448384', '25086534', '27147375', '24832358', '18440268', '12585710', '15789581', '25745872', '24598830', '30415717', '17388190', '26351901', '15629622', '15450216', '18383286', '26410118', '24746606', '26405892', '26755062', '26227167', '15753941', '20042313', '26577400', '27926377', '28039927', '16350920', '17339035', '26427644', '15977742', '21719256', '26509325', '27623782', '28994492', '25099393', '26405896', '26405887', '28129147', '19523488', '36178571', '35711072', '35009666', '33414703', '29969418', '28472943', '28269819', '23384318', '23790354', '26755062', '29969418', '28472943', '28269819', '23384318', '8591302', '29049909', '29969418', '23790354', '26755062', '29969418', '23790354', '26755062']"
Patient representation learning and interpretable evaluation using clinical notes.,"Sushil, Madhumita; Šuster, Simon; Luyckx, Kim; Daelemans, Walter",2018-07-03,"We have three contributions in this work: 1. We explore the utility of a stacked denoising autoencoder and a paragraph vector model to learn task-independent dense patient representations directly from clinical notes. To analyze if these representations are transferable across tasks, we evaluate them in multiple supervised setups to predict patient mortality, primary diagnostic and procedural category, and gender. We compare their performance with sparse representations obtained from a bag-of-words model. We observe that the learned generalized representations significantly outperform the sparse representations when we have few positive instances to learn from, and there is an absence of strong lexical features. 2. We compare the model performance of the feature set constructed from a bag of words to that obtained from medical concepts. In the latter case, concepts represent problems, treatments, and tests. We find that concept identification does not improve the classification performance. 3. We propose novel techniques to facilitate model interpretability. To understand and interpret the representations, we explore the best encoded features within the patient representations obtained from the autoencoder model. Further, we calculate feature sensitivity across two networks to identify the most significant input features for different classification tasks when we use these pretrained representations as the supervised input. We successfully extract the most influential features for the pipeline using this technique.",29966746,10.1016/j.jbi.2018.06.016,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Model interpretability; Natural language processing; Patient representations; Representation learning; Unsupervised learning,"Algorithms; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Language; Machine Learning; Male; Medical Informatics; Medical Records; Models, Statistical; Mortality; Natural Language Processing; Neural Networks, Computer; Pattern Recognition, Automated; ROC Curve; Reproducibility of Results; Semantics; Software","['29966746', '29191207', '29928997', '29109070', '23566040', '31425854', '24316051', '30537974', '29513748', '29268609', '31365274', '35049514', '30409346', '29544790', '31430550', '33873122', '36872019', '26958258', '30266231', '30017973', '29935347', '28400312', '30028714', '22374109', '27429443', '31445243', '28606869', '26481140', '27501231', '26042330', '30646240', '26547986', '17627045', '29679685', '19616641', '33453522', '30777618', '25878657', '30591037', '30864306', '28699566', '27175227', '26654210', '26386547', '21808090', '30530380', '29122011', '27046846', '30084593', '27085847', '16317074', '29295178', '21287105', '25515941', '30118854', '31421211', '29854252', '34547014', '23354284', '26941831', '29463986', '25343771', '26992191', '33340161', '24833593', '24486562', '29135365', '29402212', '30414475', '38083156', '30946674', '29993796', '27847543', '34554186', '28410513', '27266594', '29738820', '34297000', '19135551', '33711541', '11080019', '24579166', '25874581', '31137195', '29447188', '16723012', '29906585', '27081410', '28316639', '30026067', '32147441', '30510569', '26004792', '17368839', '26886968', '26633645', '33279863', '30496232', '37817825', '32169670', '31289963', '34559665', '31860341', '21658290', '33573532', '30658851', '30864307', '33790986', '32714371', '31319948', '35626462', '19435614', '34395866', '28268855', '33866304', '30172761', '38017587', '35719384', '31880568', '19236956', '36560177', '31829157', '33317504', '32168338', '33566769', '36223356', '35148686', '32025651', '25861377', '31316558', '30785004', '33035159', '34884688', '38145387', '32619795', '25152899', '33018251', '33182276', '36279331', '33693384', '30870615', '32477682', '38136454', '33625320', '26306286', '35309006', '32646413', '32357164', '34386308', '36682991', '24983963', '19041423', '35746202', '35336431', '20450985', '30296238', '31225983', '38160274', '33899482', '38269902', '37543302', '32393369', '27570647', '34354579', '33816808', '35395843', '36347888', '38227273', '38134198', '35600326', '18693937', '32835307', '32891017', '35173264', '35751992', '31980087', '34306241', '29375929', '32489519', '31722495', '35834460', '36266407', '28268856', '32801109', '23243317', '32446958', '33429140', '34954447', '31998331', '34917934', '31268306', '33286165', '37027766', '37060870', '34308444', '37782668', '33657004', '34151966', '35007885', '32997664', '34907319', '25382936', '32604623', '33163992', '32555334', '32142137', '33259943', '33196445', '33903606', '37390494', '35797320', '24191136', '32945703', '33501231', '30648795', '33137758', '32116463', '32367332', '35615056', '34915411', '35975455', '33969363', '32091880', '30714933', '26949568', '28229132', '32310790', '23755011', '29354810', '37128436', '32088249', '36064616', '33079679', '30271308', '32422757', '21552455', '33531704', '27774487', '34532709', '33954293', '35617751', '30465023', '33623933', '32915750', '34672956', '35812695', '37291197', '37995843', '35419508', '35049514', '33259943', '33121479', '32477682', '31842854', '31794016', '31259035', '31233140', '29966746', '29191207', '29928997', '29109070', '26042330', '26386547', '29966746', '29191207', '29928997', '29109070', '23566040', '31425854', '29966746', '26042330', '26386547', '31319948', '30785004', '30870615', '36682991', '35751992', '35617751', '29966746', '26042330', '26386547', '31319948', '30785004', '30870615']"
Combination of rs-fMRI and sMRI Data to Discriminate Autism Spectrum Disorders in Young Children Using Deep Belief Network.,"Akhavan Aghdam, Maryam; Sharifi, Arash; Pedram, Mir Mohsen",No date,"In recent years, the use of advanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) has recorded a great increase in neuropsychiatric disorders. Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that is increasingly being used for applications of medical image analysis such as computer-aided diagnosis. In a bid to classify and represent learning tasks, this study utilized one of the most powerful deep learning algorithms (deep belief network (DBN)) for the combination of data from Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I and II (ABIDE I and ABIDE II) datasets. The DBN was employed so as to focus on the combination of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI), gray matter (GM), and white matter (WM) data. This was done based on the brain regions that were defined using the automated anatomical labeling (AAL), in order to classify autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) from typical controls (TCs). Since the diagnosis of ASD is much more effective at an early age, only 185 individuals (116 ASD and 69 TC) ranging in age from 5 to 10 years were included in this analysis. In contrast, the proposed method is used to exploit the latent or abstract high-level features inside rs-fMRI and sMRI data while the old methods consider only the simple low-level features extracted from neuroimages. Moreover, combining multiple data types and increasing the depth of DBN can improve classification accuracy. In this study, the best combination comprised rs-fMRI, GM, and WM for DBN of depth 3 with 65.56% accuracy (sensitivity = 84%, specificity = 32.96%, F1 score = 74.76%) obtained via 10-fold cross-validation. This result outperforms previously presented methods on ABIDE I dataset.",29736781,10.1007/s10278-018-0093-8,pubmed,Journal Article,Autism spectrum disorder; Deep belief network; Gray matter; White

Combining deep residual neural network features with supervised machine learning algorithms to classify diverse food image datasets.,"McAllister, Patrick; Zheng, Huiru; Bond, Raymond; Moorhead, Anne",2018-02-17,"Obesity is increasing worldwide and can cause many chronic conditions such as type-2 diabetes, heart disease, sleep apnea, and some cancers. Monitoring dietary intake through food logging is a key method to maintain a healthy lifestyle to prevent and manage obesity. Computer vision methods have been applied to food logging to automate image classification for monitoring dietary intake. In this work we applied pretrained ResNet-152 and GoogleNet convolutional neural networks (CNNs), initially trained using ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) dataset with MatConvNet package, to extract features from food image datasets; Food 5K, Food-11, RawFooT-DB, and Food-101. Deep features were extracted from CNNs and used to train machine learning classifiers including artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. Results show that using ResNet-152 deep features with SVM with RBF kernel can accurately detect food items with 99.4% accuracy using Food-5K validation food image dataset and 98.8% with Food-5K evaluation dataset using ANN, SVM-RBF, and Random Forest classifiers. Trained with ResNet-152 features, ANN can achieve 91.34%, 99.28% when applied to Food-11 and RawFooT-DB food image datasets respectively and SVM with RBF kernel can achieve 64.98% with Food-101 image dataset. From this research it is clear that using deep CNN features can be used efficiently for diverse food item image classification. The work presented in this research shows that pretrained ResNet-152 features provide sufficient generalisation power when applied to a range of food image classification

Automatic Target Recognition Strategy for Synthetic Aperture Radar Images Based on Combined Discrimination Trees.,"Zhao, Xiaohui; Jiang, Yicheng; Stathaki, Tania",2017-11-29,"A strategy is introduced for achieving high accuracy in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR) tasks. Initially, a novel pose rectification process and an image normalization process are sequentially introduced to produce images with less variations prior to the feature processing stage. Then, feature sets that have a wealth of texture and edge information are extracted with the utilization of wavelet coefficients, where more effective and compact feature sets are acquired by reducing the redundancy and dimensionality of the extracted feature set. Finally, a group of discrimination trees are learned and combined into a final classifier in the framework of Real-AdaBoost. The proposed method is evaluated with the public release database for moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition (MSTAR). Several comparative studies are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results show the distinctive superiority of the proposed method under both standard operating conditions (SOCs) and extended operating conditions (EOCs). Moreover, our additional tests suggest that good recognition accuracy can be achieved even with limited number of training images as long as these are captured with appropriately incremental sample step in target poses.",29317862,10.1155/2017/7186120,pubmed,Journal Article,No keywords,"Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Discriminant Analysis; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Radar","['29317862', '19126469', '28117689', '27828291', '15875799', '19473938', '35162039', '30080149', '34484320', '34403341', '34202766', '36366224', '34630546', '30627147', '30249976', '21984509', '25161398', '30347661', '34394337', '17627054', '31915430', '28953267', '19054733', '17431299', '30201854', '18988947', '29104279', '18713675', '32695155', '17699917', '34300685', '16119265', '23757577', '34868287', '30181480', '28090204', '18550907', '18390380', '15742897', '16119259', '30126120', '20137998', '18270116', '25872212', '22249713', '18432467', '19497813', '18784043', '35655514', '22027372', '23144037', '16640259', '17956879', '15460279', '34903963', '25559889', '20229900', '22547457', '16524086', '18390351', '27447635', '36679740', '34868301', '25614395', '17170474', '32164293', '15742893', '19933007', '16929732', '15688560', '30301157', '34283072', '26999140', '22481825', '24051720', '24723626', '16724594', '25499960', '20051343', '18270092', '20236892', '37571739', '22315568', '36236532', '31042998', '36072737', '30486247', '37514755', '22219699', '23609804', '38169785', '34372219', '34960383', '31963588', '33096933', '36772708', '18066273', '37467585', '32204506', '30081595', '31248226', '32733549', '31035670', '33684045', '16363787', '35808455', '30703606', '35590933', '30959911', '34640964', '31266262', '31035450', '35293944', '36905024', '22399940', '31796403', '32932927', '35393486', '30275407', '28866498', '36215606', '33104618', '14735943', '29993608', '34079825', '25285325', '31362336', '31752410', '33435248', '32455685', '30011844', '34300381', '37454236', '30634519', '37837013', '33673186', '14735950', '33816941', '36501887', '19768064', '12542316', '22163464', '16639454', '16983426', '32191887', '18516129', '36035848', '15376934', '31766679', '33801252', '38339553', '36224799', '30939813', '14735946', '37050673', '30696189', '30654547', '13678355', '35290312', '18059835', '24967605', '14650490', '30985826', '33265347', '18345138', '24818249', '17609718', '11607485', '17282504', '18337888', '36082009', '29317862', '19126469', '28117689', '27828291', '15875799', '22315568', '29317862', '19126469', '28117689', '27828291', '15875799', '19473938', '25161398', '23144037', '29317862', '22315568', '29317862', '22315568']"

Endoscopic Image Classification and Retrieval using Clustered Convolutional Features.,"Ahmad, Jamil; Muhammad, Khan; Lee, Mi Young; Baik, Sung Wook",2017-10-30,"With the growing use of minimally invasive surgical procedures, endoscopic video archives are growing at a rapid pace. Efficient access to relevant content in such huge multimedia archives require compact and discriminative visual features for indexing and matching. In this paper, we present an effective method to represent images using salient convolutional features. Convolutional kernels from the first layer of a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) are analyzed and clustered into multiple distinct groups, based on their sensitivity to colors and textures. Dominant features detected by each cluster are collected into a single, layout-preserving feature map using a spatial maximal activator pooling (SMAP) approach. A moving window based structured pooling method then captures spatial layout features and global shape information from the aggregated feature map to populate feature histograms. Finally, individual histograms for each cluster are combined into a single comprehensive feature histogram. Clustering convolutional feature space allow extraction of color and texture features of varying strengths. Further, the SMAP approach enable us to select dominant discriminative features. The proposed features are compact and capable of conveniently outperforming several existing features extraction approaches in retrieval and classification tasks on endoscopy images dataset.",29086034,10.1007/s10916-017-0836-y,pubmed,Journal Article,Classification; Convolution; Endoscopy; Features extraction; Image retrieval; Spatial pooling,"Algorithms; Endoscopy; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Multimedia; Neural Networks, Computer; Pattern Recognition, Automated","['29086034', '29260348', '29544790', '29372327', '26353135', '28771497', '28859140', '26132080', '29993796', '27959804', '28850876', '32589586', '28316614', '18270126', '29428072', '29845806', '29126070', '15495304', '27847543', '28475048', '28357628', '29897318', '26887016', '32479504', '27668999', '24951701', '31184071', '28459832', '28113927', '31121417', '31933675', '30298337', '27992359', '30231472', '31125914', '29486380', '27258404', '27831894', '28114041', '28676295', '19273018', '28205307', '18579943', '30208096', '30159833', '24146821', '18595149', '26405887', '29994246', '28843091', '30055530', '24951697', '29159706', '19342342', '29949023', '29623089', '28410112', '17001990', '16964876', '30423850', '30111995', '21824847', '27498058', '32344381', '29577169', '35449738', '32028568', '23858770', '35669646', '29687192', '29778931', '29335825', '29727275', '31138159', '28743618', '28114043', '24951700', '16119265', '17131668', '30987018', '35153387', '19762928', '28070212', '30360445', '30249976', '30540804', '29056541', '16402628', '26955021', '29985135', '30280254', '12583150', '27822698', '20181543', '21859616', '17318705', '22547459', '36156953', '29870348', '15742897', '18789648', '25595511', '16986547', '33946745', '20137998', '26941831', '32866099', '36081117', '26950929', '17131669', '31984630', '29780407', '29990115', '28335510', '25948335', '32252483', '35568744', '31148564', '32275599', '28983571', '31136610', '31641865', '30830652', '28368819', '30669531', '30892256', '35494856', '36846979', '33275580', '32502799', '30561353', '9327275', '30594014', '29352405', '28706534', '31499617', '30840751', '33299393', '30881442', '29566042', '29181087', '29993843', '32405291', '31065055', '32086198', '29250109', '32372771', '33765530', '29990193', '31418627', '29510529', '30987172', '29994008', '36179513', '30603191', '31176962', '28800442', '34741848', '29994215', '29936360', '35336358', '28113718', '33434208', '28264503', '30872228', '34343780', '31069547', '24111130', '38139563', '28792895', '28587269', '33611127', '31946675', '37131063', '9228585', '34411098', '28359221', '30428600', '33286193', '28866491', '30452367', '32992580', '35560082', '19162888', '28465714', '28708546', '29994213', '35125669', '30744191', '37811325', '32894715', '29929102', '9442434', '12372687', '33074826', '32045796', '34111005', '30856387', '29610107', '24391704', '33444137', '28603299', '30646611', '22003634', '33459977', '36135404', '28234999', '29914068', '29990080', '27455522', '31940574', '28114059', '31135368', '30106728', '28278457', '12234722', '32502224', '31135362', '32841131', '25847670', '32151916', '31283499', '35694579', '29075965', '28682266', '30281422', '33018199', '30558810', '36330268', '30452362', '30646617', '35320996', '30629491', '29236678', '34681983', '32286989', '30634639', '32326059', '33265431', '28003793', '35056179', '32825587', '31652552', '19163133', '33233380', '19417814', '30371368', '31656834', '30072662', '28113522', '30869616', '26485983', '31478853', '21912534', '29874262', '37810358', '31035732', '33544676', '29990281', '28858800', '35448231', '30714921', '33378921', '31944977', '29993720', '30439950', '17282545', '32403804', '10719486', '31585558', '28804496', '35519251', '35242945', '29985134', '29671741', '30130178', '16525689', '31995486', '35877635', '33819157', '37889906', '30703019', '30518140', '33265837', '30530364', '30281450', '23833704', '29469809', '29994607', '26736379', '36523632', '25685143', '23543920', '21096629', '26798574', '31944946', '33540828', '14577539', '11859265', '31061817', '32942607', '24839388', '28459674', '34460457', '37189488', '36777535', '36262620', '35251578', '33817058', '33037490', '32998466', '32859981', '30949770', '30298337', '29260348', '29086034', '29260348', '29544790', '29372327', '30298337', '12583150', '29086034', '29260348', '29544790', '29372327', '26353135', '28771497', '29086034', '30298337', '12583150', '35125669', '29075965', '11859265', '29086034', '30298337', '12583150', '35125669', '29075965', '11859265']"

Rapid Development of Specialty Population Registries and Quality Measures from Electronic Health Record Data*. An Agile Framework.,"Kannan, Vaishnavi; Fish, Jason S; Mutz, Jacqueline M; Carrington, Angela R; Lai, Ki; Davis, Lisa S; Youngblood, Josh E; Rauschuber, Mark R; Flores, Kathryn A; Sara, Evan J; Bhat, Deepa G; Willett, DuWayne L",2017-06-14,"Creation of a new electronic health record (EHR)-based registry often can be a ""one-off"" complex endeavor: first developing new EHR data collection and clinical decision support tools, followed by developing registry-specific data extractions from the EHR for analysis. Each development phase typically has its own long development and testing time, leading to a prolonged overall cycle time for delivering one functioning registry with companion reporting into production. The next registry request then starts from scratch. Such an approach will not scale to meet the emerging demand for specialty registries to support population health and value-based care.",28930362,10.3414/ME16-02-0031,pubmed,Journal

Automated diagnosis of prostate cancer in multi-parametric MRI based on multimodal convolutional neural networks.,"Le, Minh Hung; Chen, Jingyu; Wang, Liang; Wang, Zhiwei; Liu, Wenyu; Cheng, Kwang-Ting Tim; Yang, Xin",2017-07-24,"Automated methods for prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis in multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRIs) are critical for alleviating requirements for interpretation of radiographs while helping to improve diagnostic accuracy (Artan et al 2010 IEEE Trans. Image Process. 19 2444-55, Litjens et al 2014 IEEE Trans. Med. Imaging 33 1083-92, Liu et al 2013 SPIE Medical Imaging (International Society for Optics and Photonics) p 86701G, Moradi et al 2012 J.

This paper presents an automated method based on multimodal convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for two PCa diagnostic tasks: (1) distinguishing between cancerous and noncancerous tissues and (2) distinguishing between clinically significant (CS) and indolent PCa. Specifically, our multimodal CNNs effectively fuse apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) and T2-weighted MP-MRI images (T2WIs). To effectively fuse ADCs and T2WIs we design a new similarity loss function to enforce consistent features being extracted from both ADCs and T2WIs. The similarity loss is combined with the conventional classification loss functions and integrated into the back-propagation procedure of CNN training. The similarity loss enables better fusion results than existing methods as the feature learning processes of both modalities are mutually guided, jointly facilitating CNN to 'see' the true visual patterns of PCa. The classification results of multimodal CNNs are further combined with the results based on handcrafted features using a support vector machine classifier. To achieve a satisfactory accuracy for clinical use, we comprehensively investigate three critical factors which could greatly affect the performance of our multimodal CNNs but have not been carefully studied previously. (1) Given limited training data, how can these be augmented in sufficient numbers and variety for fine-tuning deep CNN networks for PCa diagnosis? (2) How can multimodal MP-MRI information be effectively combined in CNNs? (3) What is the impact of different CNN architectures on the accuracy of PCa diagnosis? Experimental results on extensive clinical data from 364 patients with a total of 463 PCa lesions and 450 identified noncancerous image patches demonstrate that our system can achieve a sensitivity of 89.85% and a specificity of 95.83% for distinguishing cancer from noncancerous tissues and a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 76.92% for distinguishing indolent PCa from CS PCa. This result is significantly superior to the state-of-the-art method relying on handcrafted features.",28582269,10.1088/1361-6560/aa7731,pubmed,Journal Article,No keywords,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over;

ZK DrugResist 2.0: A TextMiner to extract semantic relations of drug resistance from PubMed.,"Khalid, Zoya; Sezerman, Osman Ugur",2017-04-04,"Extracting useful knowledge from an unstructured textual data is a challenging task for biologists, since biomedical literature is growing exponentially on a daily basis. Building an automated method for such tasks is gaining much attention of researchers. ZK DrugResist is an online tool that automatically extracts mutations and expression changes associated with drug resistance from PubMed. In this study we have extended our tool to include semantic relations extracted from biomedical text covering drug resistance and established a server including both of these features. Our system was tested for three relations, Resistance (R), Intermediate (I) and Susceptible (S) by applying hybrid feature set. From the last few decades the focus has changed to hybrid approaches as it provides better results. In our case this approach combines rule-based methods with machine learning techniques. The results showed 97.67% accuracy with 96% precision, recall and F-measure. The results have outperformed the previously existing relation extraction systems thus can facilitate computational analysis of drug resistance against complex diseases and further can be implemented on other areas of biomedicine.",28389233,10.1016/j.jbi.2017.04.002,pubmed,Journal Article,Drug resistance; Hybrid approach; Machine learning; NLP; Relation extraction; Rule based methods,Drug Resistance; Humans; Machine Learning; PubMed; Semantics,"['28389233', '27312781', '26347797', '27016698', '28678823', '29368597', '31711540', '27121612', '26481140', '30048465', '30020437', '28423846', '30066655', '25887686', '27597572', '26851224', '26774763', '25592675', '28365720', '29506465', '29122011', '26201262', '28034407', '27087307', '27444185', '33106154', '16095962', '28606870', '28938902', '27080229', '28673289', '25755127', '23347886', '26941831', '28938912', '38269887', '17090325', '27510445', '25943550', '27216254', '21828087', '17990494', '26994911', '15360914', '25949785', '28053977', '29801951', '22879773', '30986506', '26262109', '26394441', '26323337', '28050714', '26262332', '27338146', '25925131', '28894463', '28748229', '23937724', '33816997', '29678094', '36268087', '26306265', '35623021', '30256986', '28649288', '29937618', '9952983', '36008431', '28389233', '27312781', '26347797', '27016698', '33106154', '28938912', '28389233', '27312781', '26347797', '27016698', '28678823', '29368597', '28389233', '33106154', '28938912', '28389233', '33106154', '28938912']"
Automated Analysis of Intracellular Dynamic Processes.,"Yao, Yao; Smal, Ihor; Grigoriev, Ilya; Martin, Maud; Akhmanova, Anna; Meijering, Erik",No date,"The study of intracellular dynamic processes is of fundamental importance for understanding a wide variety of diseases and developing effective drugs and therapies. Advanced fluorescence microscopy imaging systems nowadays allow the recording of virtually any type of process in space and time with super-resolved detail and with high sensitivity and specificity. The large volume and high information content of the resulting image data, and the desire to obtain objective, quantitative descriptions and biophysical models of the processes of interest, require a high level of automation in data analysis. Two key tasks in extracting biologically meaningful information about intracellular dynamics from image data are particle tracking and particle trajectory analysis.

Multichannel Convolutional Neural Network for Biological Relation Extraction.,"Quan, Chanqin; Hua, Lei; Sun, Xiao; Bai, Wenjun",2016-12-07,"The plethora of biomedical relations which are embedded in medical logs (records) demands researchers' attention. Previous theoretical and practical focuses were restricted on traditional machine learning techniques. However, these methods are susceptible to the issues of ""vocabulary gap"" and data sparseness and the unattainable automation process in feature extraction. To address aforementioned issues, in this work, we propose a multichannel convolutional neural network (MCCNN) for automated biomedical relation extraction. The proposed model has the following two contributions: (1) it enables the fusion of multiple (e.g., five) versions in word embeddings; (2) the need for manual feature engineering can be obviated by automated feature learning with convolutional neural network (CNN). We evaluated our model on two biomedical relation extraction tasks: drug-drug interaction (DDI) extraction and protein-protein interaction (PPI) extraction. For DDI task, our system achieved an overall f-score of 70.2% compared to the standard linear SVM based system (e.g., 67.0%) on DDIExtraction 2013 challenge dataset. And for PPI task, we evaluated our system on Aimed and BioInfer PPI corpus; our system exceeded the state-of-art ensemble SVM system by 2.7% and 5.6% on f-scores.",28053977,10.1155/2016/1850404,pubmed,Journal Article,No keywords,"Algorithms; Biomedical Research; Data Mining; Drug Interactions; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Protein Interaction Mapping; Support Vector Machine","['28053977', '26941831', '27493967', '28605776', '29297321', '29373599', '27466626', '29601989', '30020437', '30822516', '29382397', '31710668', '28254085', '29146561', '32335223', '32804372', '25796456', '29297301', '26347797', '29084508', '32131522', '30183640', '29099838', '26262126', '29897318', '30066652', '26432353', '31138159', '33266753', '29236678', '30970672', '29368597', '34653224', '30567477', '29017459', '24858490', '26950929', '34531012', '21834129', '25143286', '27913371', '30700331', '28359255', '29025149', '30118854', '30861669', '29559249', '27510445', '30337082', '28800619', '25864936', '30142385', '30010731', '24372037', '26390497', '29151135', '27127603', '31717300', '27241666', '21945347', '29281701', '28622674', '31795930', '31769759', '28727737', '28433431', '31800044', '30296491', '31396271', '28555888', '30590613', '28459832', '35161459', '33259890', '25036529', '28191461', '30266231', '30017973', '29714928', '30385092', '20671316', '30576487', '29228051', '25821508', '30048465', '36416141', '29186323', '27610128', '31492112', '30332463', '32019410', '30137284', '32248129', '31200912', '32143790', '27019494', '24622773', '34524450', '31568842', '26955465', '30755172', '29297367', '28157556', '29661577', '32028883', '19501018', '33323106', '26797612', '34628063', '28984180', '27281032', '25339081', '29778673', '19025688', '30240803', '32459636', '30296207', '21545845', '27473064', '28502909', '24489368', '31176041', '35181524', '21062765', '24898862', '29945178', '31437949', '27695078', '26551925', '30119852', '26054427', '34671814', '28415073', '35965308', '28423791', '28146106', '26481140', '25863986', '26829785', '31144641', '28475069', '27454611', '36536280', '31202937', '26285054', '37168529', '26826901', '20406505', '28230767', '26453758', '27081156', '29961818', '28269875', '27118966', '29471196', '14871877', '29536444', '32677883', '21884822', '30521143', '29746916', '26881999', '19706337', '31113357', '34892083', '28268449', '31686105', '26985826', '17385623', '19758784', '29297359', '27052618', '15130823', '30518099', '22595237', '32454243', '23911582', '25659452', '28789210', '30961599', '30239680', '23974658', '27092505', '33801894', '28910352', '30947439', '27744173', '30791587', '28864104', '29940927', '30223767', '30923284', '30302123', '30295718', '27524807', '35189639', '30902121', '27832103', '31707129', '29870927', '36064114', '37514010', '32068034', '27012903', '28389233', '35726325', '37887054', '27782787', '33098410', '33571676', '27282231', '30404477', '34073745', '28948531', '29532403', '32667950', '31510363', '27542188', '29532063', '33258777', '30332807', '29034375', '29218875', '27007977', '27986644', '34298157', '32804374', '28129583', '28492252', '30216873', '31963622', '29477265', '35814595', '30613031', '23785452', '29990101', '30106710', '34027520', '22166257', '26772057', '28410049', '30982831', '29047798', '35874184', '29857138', '29986110', '29908903', '32837244', '27559342', '29194126', '37514010', '36699388', '35965308', '35832629', '35659292', '34524450', '34422092', '34407869', '34064731', '34031788', '33266753', '33106154', '33098410', '32984300', '32469325', '31795930', '31603193', '31533622', '31125403', '30576487', '30515316', '29897318', '29618526', '29373599', '29077847', '29017459', '28053977', '26941831', '27493967', '28605776', '27241666', '27473064', '28053977', '26941831', '27493967', '28605776', '29297321', '29373599', '27466626', '25864936', '25796456', '25036529', '24203711', '22121220', '21545845', '21489220', '21208788', '21059682', '19501018', '17291334', '17142812', '15811782', '11911893', '28053977', '27241666', '27473064', '29536444', '31686105', '15130823', '27282231', '27007977', '25214883', '27559342', '29194126', '28053977', '27241666', '27473064', '29536444', '31686105', '15130823']"

Using Fractal and Local Binary Pattern Features for Classification of ECOG Motor Imagery Tasks Obtained from the Right Brain Hemisphere.,"Xu, Fangzhou; Zhou, Weidong; Zhen, Yilin; Yuan, Qi; Wu, Qi",2016-03-29,"The feature extraction and classification of brain signal is very significant in brain-computer interface (BCI). In this study, we describe an algorithm for motor imagery (MI) classification of electrocorticogram (ECoG)-based BCI. The proposed approach employs multi-resolution fractal measures and local binary pattern (LBP) operators to form a combined feature for characterizing an ECoG epoch recording from the right hemisphere of the brain. A classifier is trained by using the gradient boosting in conjunction with ordinary least squares (OLS) method. The fractal intercept, lacunarity and LBP features are extracted to classify imagined movements of either the left small finger or the tongue. Experimental results on dataset I of BCI competition III demonstrate the superior performance of our method. The cross-validation accuracy and accuracy is 90.6% and 95%, respectively.

"Pattern Classification of Instantaneous Cognitive Task-load Through GMM Clustering, Laplacian Eigenmap, and Ensemble SVMs.","Zhang, Jianhua; Yin, Zhong; Wang, Rubin",2016-05-03,"The identification of the temporal variations in human operator cognitive task-load (CTL) is crucial for preventing possible accidents in human-machine collaborative systems. Recent literature has shown that the change of discrete CTL level during human-machine system operations can be objectively recognized using neurophysiological data and supervised learning technique. The objective of this work is to design subject-specific multi-class CTL classifier to reveal the complex unknown relationship between the operator's task performance and neurophysiological features by combining target class labeling, physiological feature reduction and selection, and ensemble classification techniques. The psychophysiological data acquisition experiments were performed under multiple human-machine process control tasks. Four or five target classes of CTL were determined by using a Gaussian mixture model and three human performance variables. By using Laplacian eigenmap, a few salient EEG features were extracted, and heart rates were used as the input features of the CTL classifier. Then, multiple support vector machines were aggregated via majority voting to create an ensemble classifier for recognizing the CTL classes. Finally, the obtained CTL classification results were compared with those of several existing methods. The results showed that the proposed methods are capable of deriving a reasonable number of target classes and low-dimensional optimal EEG features for individual human operator subjects.",27164601,10.1109/TCBB.2016.2561927,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,"Adult; Algorithms; Cluster Analysis; Cognition; Computational Biology; Electroencephalography; Humans; Machine Learning; Male; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Psychophysics; Software; Support Vector Machine; Task Performance and Analysis; Workload; Young Adult","['27164601', '24821400', '28367110', '21867763', '26493860', '26563686', '31059900', '28407777', '31662787', '25103878', '35214523', '32911809', '21840403', '19439361', '22954478', '25304363', '25649845', '26985826', '34986098', '27376723', '26079845', '26296799', '35863122', '32947265', '25997573', '27754580', '34015757', '15732402', '26336665', '23845911', '28140627', '29948907', '25528632', '25549938', '16531345', '27101613', '25879039', '24637294', '26655346', '28113291', '25227006', '25802511', '26405953', '25629798', '33080866', '26674595', '34198044', '28146679', '26405957', '38127869', '31946643', '26690450', '26544549', '28325450', '26803769', '26192325', '31946870', '16354384', '25037827', '28391822', '28391816', '27069469', '27891256', '23574821', '16723012', '31601182', '27087307', '26576199', '23867792', '20129853', '25704869', '21733774', '23158697', '26405922', '21079276', '26357050', '26955018', '28372267', '28414729', '34973030', '33231858', '27278475', '26489759', '24427221', '28859826', '28521242', '30345602', '30668486', '18562478', '31398917', '27032108', '28113599', '29132615', '37117157', '28745552', '37960659', '24076750', '34040669', '33054415', '25570618', '28245947', '29373231', '27780715', '33438285', '31575147', '24108722', '31946697', '35759604', '29023364', '31905373', '35979334', '30629616', '30296625', '30416438', '36088813', '28373684', '30975632', '35858242', '26737963', '35673130', '34166183', '31946738', '33408623', '26406166', '34416572', '29544139', '29401688', '36616939', '26737972', '27514582', '31499356', '31998469', '24752287', '30380784', '28320651', '30645617', '34641001', '25249967', '35069348', '34069456', '27644256', '34434758', '30768635', '24155915', '26277013', '31868704', '32876676', '27445204', '32426346', '33370917', '31946157', '24319303', '31572146', '30440439', '35624928', '30334774', '11447665', '38370245', '30503919', '31754000', '34712103', '15677140', '15676376', '28438960', '35079025', '33335465', '31856818', '27164601', '24821400', '28367110', '21867763', '26690450', '18562478', '27164601', '24821400', '28367110', '21867763', '26493860', '26563686', '27164601', '26690450', '18562478', '31946738', '30503919', '27164601', '26690450', '18562478', '31946738', '30503919']"
Drug-Drug Interaction Extraction via Convolutional Neural Networks.,"Liu, Shengyu; Tang, Buzhou; Chen, Qingcai; Wang, Xiaolong",2016-01-31,"Drug-drug interaction (DDI) extraction as a typical relation extraction task in natural language processing (NLP) has always attracted great attention. Most state-of-the-art DDI extraction systems are based on support vector machines (SVM) with a large number of manually defined features. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN), a robust machine learning method which almost does not need manually defined features, has exhibited great potential for many NLP tasks. It is worth employing CNN for DDI extraction, which has never been investigated. We proposed a CNN-based method for DDI extraction. Experiments conducted on the 2013 DDIExtraction challenge corpus demonstrate that CNN is a good choice for DDI extraction. The CNN-based DDI extraction method achieves an F-score of 69.75%, which outperforms the existing best performing method by 2.75%.",26941831,10.1155/2016/6918381,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research

Unsupervised Deep Learning Applied to Breast Density Segmentation and Mammographic Risk Scoring.,"Kallenberg, Michiel; Petersen, Kersten; Nielsen, Mads; Ng, Andrew Y; Pengfei Diao, ; Igel, Christian; Vachon, Celine M; Holland, Katharina; Winkel, Rikke Rass; Karssemeijer, Nico; Lillholm, Martin",2016-02-18,"Mammographic risk scoring has commonly been automated by extracting a set of handcrafted features from mammograms, and relating the responses directly or indirectly to breast cancer risk. We present a method that learns a feature hierarchy from unlabeled data. When the learned features are used as the input to a simple classifier, two different tasks can be addressed: i) breast density segmentation, and ii) scoring of mammographic texture. The proposed model learns features at multiple scales. To control the models capacity a novel sparsity regularizer is introduced that incorporates both lifetime and population sparsity. We evaluated our method on three different clinical datasets. Our state-of-the-art results show that the learned breast density scores have a very strong positive relationship with manual ones, and that the learned texture scores are predictive of breast cancer. The model is easy to apply and generalizes to many other segmentation and scoring problems.",26915120,10.1109/TMI.2016.2532122,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,"Adult; Aged; Breast; Breast Density; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Mammography; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Unsupervised Machine Learning","['26915120', '30375931', '29720220', '26133615', '29239858', '30856154', '29210358', '28726117', '29141776', '31319940', '31545461', '23636749', '28391823', '30337080', '29047382', '29392583', '27420382', '32012021', '25851469', '15125012', '31985411', '26498046', '21306782', '28035663', '27645219', '26127038', '32755754', '31034648', '37340148', '19828291', '23806533', '27187523', '37880807', '26151831', '30128778', '34537490', '15894652', '16039540', '31989390', '14713971', '27806604', '26546074', '16716579', '30040652', '16835331', '28094850', '11488579', '25795630', '27283069', '31607343', '20540910', '26831342', '35124595', '16013719', '24446230', '11811827', '26992182', '17716895', '20544272', '15191279', '21146484', '12715992', '19166192', '25776767', '25720034', '30838510', '32089465', '31722327', '29399874', '30908205', '36661713', '31783496', '36585732', '28472204', '29432100', '37023727', '34532866', '30403624', '28129148', '34940873', '17879813', '28376632', '37167927', '29994498', '26540668', '32658733', '34817549', '33018407', '34449016', '34800367', '28825881', '35416356', '35690078', '37034359', '30325286', '34491135', '32954589', '34648656', '31846401', '32812799', '29944080', '32936199', '31500932', '30343029', '27497072', '28212138', '28094850', '27908154', '29159811', '27273294', '28681390', '27610399', '29234806', '29021992', '27212078', '28932980', '28035663', '29210358', '29428071', '29035873', '28920897', '28105470', '27475279', '27079888', '26955021', '26917105', '29426948', '28656455', '27046846', '26978662', '26930677', '29395798', '32064299', '31545461', '29720220', '29352006', '28052757', '27923387', '27806604', '32629712', '30032964', '28171807', '33238512', '31667873', '37780685', '37568545', '37368543', '37034359', '37023727', '36792270', '36749212', '36522545', '36476319', '36425614', '36267967', '36262625', '36078635', '36011022', '36010173', '35835933', '35771379', '35408080', '35219978', '35184757', '35146431', '35124595', '35102179', '35029818', '34883946', '34677291', '34650476', '34564116', '34562926', '34491131', '34460472', '34282411', '34059687', '33987993', '33885240', '33805558', '33525807', '33514930', '33437307', '33437132', '33431003', '33425040', '33304615', '33278767', '33238512', '33152716', '33062608', '32760624', '32574113', '32477610', '32468486', '32447262', '32245523', '32243657', '32064299', '31972556', '31853462', '31752353', '31742424', '31623646', '31545461', '31450799', '31448210', '31350843', '31167642', '31166769', '31134366', '31095624', '31093789', '31019680', '30944574', '30783371', '30746393', '30713130', '30367497', '30306701', '30306418', '30261827', '29944078', '29777175', '29720220', '29556766', '29522900', '29402289', '29395798', '29363774', '29320532', '29210358', '29159811', '29047382', '28932980', '28854966', '28821822', '28819715', '28670152', '28622671', '28270976', '28191461', '27893402', '27730417', '27645219', '27387546', '26915120', '30375931', '29720220', '26133615', '27645219', '31989390', '26915120', '30375931', '29720220', '26133615', '29239858', '30856154', '26915120', '27645219', '31989390', '26546074', '26992182', '36585732', '34449016', '26915120', '27645219', '31989390', '26546074', '26992182', '36585732']"
Deep Convolutional and LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks for Multimodal Wearable Activity Recognition.,"Ordóñez, Francisco Javier; Roggen, Daniel",2016-01-18,"Human activity recognition (HAR) tasks have traditionally been solved using engineered features obtained by heuristic processes. Current research suggests that deep convolutional neural networks are suited to automate feature extraction from raw sensor inputs. However, human activities are made of complex sequences of motor movements, and capturing this temporal dynamics is fundamental for successful HAR. Based on the recent success of recurrent neural networks for time series domains, we propose a generic deep framework for activity recognition based on convolutional and LSTM recurrent units, which: (i) is suitable for multimodal wearable sensors; (ii) can perform sensor fusion naturally; (iii) does not require expert knowledge in designing features; and (iv) explicitly models the temporal dynamics of feature activations. We evaluate our framework on two datasets, one of which has been used in a public activity recognition challenge. Our results show that our framework outperforms competing deep non-recurrent networks on the challenge dataset by 4% on average; outperforming some of the previous reported results by up to 9%. Our results show that the framework can be applied to homogeneous sensor modalities, but can also fuse multimodal sensors to improve performance. We characterise key architectural hyperparameters' influence on performance to provide insights about their optimisation.",26797612,10.3390/s16010115,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support,

"Analysis of in vivo single cell behavior by high throughput, human-in-the-loop segmentation of three-dimensional images.","Chiang, Michael; Hallman, Sam; Cinquin, Amanda; de Mochel, Nabora Reyes; Paz, Adrian; Kawauchi, Shimako; Calof, Anne L; Cho, Ken W; Fowlkes, Charless C; Cinquin, Olivier",2015-11-25,"Analysis of single cells in their native environment is a powerful method to address key questions in developmental systems biology. Confocal microscopy imaging of intact tissues, followed by automatic image segmentation, provides a means to conduct cytometric studies while at the same time preserving crucial information about the spatial organization of the tissue and morphological features of the cells. This technique is rapidly evolving but is still not in widespread use among research groups that do not specialize in technique development, perhaps in part for lack of tools that automate repetitive tasks while allowing experts to make the best use of their time in injecting their domain-specific knowledge.",26607933,10.1186/s12859-015-0814-7,pubmed,"Journal Article;

Exploiting ensemble learning for automatic cataract detection and grading.,"Yang, Ji-Jiang; Li, Jianqiang; Shen, Ruifang; Zeng, Yang; He, Jian; Bi, Jing; Li, Yong; Zhang, Qinyan; Peng, Lihui; Wang, Qing",2015-10-24,"Cataract is defined as a lenticular opacity presenting usually with poor visual acuity. It is one of the most common causes of visual impairment worldwide. Early diagnosis demands the expertise of trained healthcare professionals, which may present a barrier to early intervention due to underlying costs. To date, studies reported in the literature utilize a single learning model for retinal image classification in grading cataract severity. We present an ensemble learning based approach as a means to improving diagnostic accuracy. Three independent feature sets, i.e., wavelet-, sketch-, and texture-based features, are extracted from each fundus image. For each feature set, two base learning models, i.e., Support Vector Machine and Back Propagation Neural Network, are built. Then, the ensemble methods, majority voting and stacking, are investigated to combine the multiple base learning models for final fundus image classification. Empirical experiments are conducted for cataract detection (two-class task, i.e., cataract or non-cataractous) and cataract grading (four-class task, i.e., non-cataractous, mild, moderate or severe) tasks. The best performance of the ensemble classifier is 93.2% and 84.5% in terms of the correct classification rates for cataract detection and grading tasks, respectively. The results demonstrate that the ensemble classifier outperforms the single learning model significantly, which also illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",26563686,10.1016/j.cmpb.2015.10.007,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Cataract detection; Ensemble learning; Fundus image classification; Neural network; Support vector machines,"Algorithms; Cataract; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Machine Learning; Ophthalmoscopy; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity","['26563686', '29124453', '23366911', '26574297', '24579174', '20426185', '22255472', '20172776', '31450174', '30677193', '18713675', '20187212', '26321351', '28282591', '25103878', '22481810', '24951700', '23193310', '24974010', '17948727', '28167406', '26119460', '21529372', '26362074', '25727143', '18195433', '18432467', '27086033', '25122849', '20137998', '22997127', '26353308', '18701402', '16350920', '24495469', '26094859', '22531763', '25082065', '15889546', '24962336', '26405887', '23549894', '25499960', '26014883', '24548898', '26930672', '19004715', '29796834', '24474370', '19430906', '23867282', '26742891', '26649335', '15742897', '18334427', '26011883', '16229415', '23807442', '23529089', '26405896', '16566507', '17019857', '25227048', '23629858', '17948726', '27164601', '28125274', '24411103', '26405925', '23185959', '28737267', '29158061', '31662787', '28140627', '31059460', '26886962', '29994702', '26660692', '27507324', '31319964', '27822698', '25488223', '30172091', '27389571', '29524784', '28924815', '37960659', '27835638', '31295110', '29065620', '31256009', '34752858', '31814951', '35317470', '28247304', '29623089', '28943731', '29075939', '28419025', '30581459', '31398938', '29852962', '36306121', '32234546', '29095872', '31272902', '26693249', '35214523', '33485073', '27754580', '32144650', '19965005', '32889406', '26660889', '28279863', '28306716', '19965109', '29157442', '28521242', '37891986', '31310757', '26210423', '25571035', '36430631', '25405514', '36286352', '31946643', '21096488', '35591061', '26737478', '26336118', '30883275', '33747071', '34925542', '29533895', '33987248', '30344616', '30256126', '26737432', '26210419', '22254661', '31270634', '32420387', '34833551', '34035389', '31023253', '31946676', '9168593', '28692998', '17578580', '31631918', '26881999', '31972986', '22255762', '28127385', '36617797', '31244314', '30215167', '26251292', '28245947', '30547238', '34727933', '24108722', '28113599', '25706988', '36994397', '31281338', '27069469', '34460540', '29277009', '34190641', '22528057', '28096890', '27311605', '38222353', '30650087', '32365937', '34353324', '35408211', '28320651', '31946738', '34460585', '36832205', '28295412', '31449533', '29544787', '34121816', '29477420', '32502224', '29599951', '32040180', '25570068', '37420378', '31031212', '35893185', '27690054', '37263110', '36497497', '31425063', '34469289', '26736882', '15581813', '33860445', '28956772', '36199373', '34115585', '30919127', '35965845', '37874703', '34416572', '36071434', '32520713', '3793374', '35100108', '33237926', '27449947', '31438159', '23797996', '27227721', '28325452', '33370917', '31118323', '34116660', '36086638', '33571099', '28597010', '30794608', '36560084', '35885672', '30424344', '35885650', '35051184', '29220317', '30912940', '27367703', '27445204', '33048687', '29993956', '27490713', '26158024', '28252414', '36766522', '31684178', '28103556', '29993965', '30908218', '25942640', '34943525', '31502971', '30726647', '15136869', '24982986', '32051022', '32610614', '34793316', '28816670', '27006870', '31394750', '28428493', '30273168', '36177320', '31409827', '35885434', '37362719', '29562609', '33356573', '29531060', '36212538', '31991724', '36590081', '36569384', '17282740', '37698970', '33266345', '30130216', '28193441', '31467782', '35216748', '14221255', '33299133', '32740061', '31450174', '29506863', '29045329', '31481392', '38104223', '37888304', '37095516', '36884203', '36875760', '36766500', '36553174', '36249697', '35938155', '35655854', '35559018', '35270949', '34996524', '34536209', '34353324', '33987248', '33688432', '32818085', '31897799', '31695786', '30581604', '29121946', '29065620', '26563686', '29124453', '23366911', '26574297', '26353308', '28125274', '26563686', '29124453', '23366911', '26574297', '24579174', '20426185', '26563686', '26353308', '28125274', '31319964', '31946738', '28956772', '28428493', '26563686', '26353308', '28125274', '31319964', '31946738', '28956772']"

Comparison of spatial filters and features for the detection and classification of movement-related cortical potentials in healthy individuals and stroke patients.,"Jochumsen, Mads; Niazi, Imran Khan; Mrachacz-Kersting, Natalie; Jiang, Ning; Farina, Dario; Dremstrup, Kim",2015-07-27,"The possibility of detecting movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) at the single trial level has been explored for closing the motor control loop with brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for neurorehabilitation. A distinct feature of MRCPs is that the movement kinetic information is encoded in the brain potential prior to the onset of the movement, which makes it possible to timely drive external devices to provide sensory feedback according to the efferent activity from the brain. The aim of this study was to compare methods for the detection (different spatial filters) and classification (features extracted from various domains) of MRCPs from continuous electroencephalography recordings from executed and imagined movements from healthy subjects (n = 24) and attempted movements from stroke patients (n = 6) to optimize the performance of MRCP-based BCIs for neurorehabilitation.",26214339,10.1088/1741-2560/12/5/056003,pubmed,"Comparative Study;

Extracting drug-drug interactions from literature using a rich feature-based linear kernel approach.,"Kim, Sun; Liu, Haibin; Yeganova, Lana; Wilbur, W John",2015-03-19,"Identifying unknown drug interactions is of great benefit in the early detection of adverse drug reactions. Despite existence of several resources for drug-drug interaction (DDI) information, the wealth of such information is buried in a body of unstructured medical text which is growing exponentially. This calls for developing text mining techniques for identifying DDIs. The state-of-the-art DDI extraction methods use Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with non-linear composite kernels to explore diverse contexts in literature. While computationally less expensive, linear kernel-based systems have not achieved a comparable performance in DDI extraction tasks. In this work, we propose an efficient and scalable system using a linear kernel to identify DDI information. The proposed approach consists of two steps: identifying DDIs and assigning one of four different DDI types to the predicted drug pairs. We demonstrate that when equipped with a rich set of lexical and syntactic features, a linear SVM classifier is able to achieve a competitive performance in detecting DDIs. In addition, the one-against-one strategy proves vital for addressing an imbalance issue in DDI type classification. Applied to the DDIExtraction 2013 corpus, our system achieves an F1 score of 0.670, as compared to 0.651 and 0.609 reported by the top two participating teams in the DDIExtraction 2013 challenge, both based on non-linear kernel methods.",25796456,10.1016/j.jbi.2015.03.002,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural",Biomedical literature; Drug–drug interaction; Linear kernel approach,"Data Mining; Drug Interactions; Natural Language Processing; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Periodicals as Topic; Semantics; Support Vector Machine; Vocabulary, Controlled","['25796456', '24858490', '29373599', '26941831', '25143286', '27585838', '27012903', '26432353', '25385082', '25961290', '28605776', '27466626', '21545845', '30565313', '27431037', '28053977', '36064114', '26955465', '23906817', '29559249', '37914988', '29017459', '23133662', '21834129', '34531012', '26262330', '31870276', '24459452', '25879039', '24800214', '23424145', '31144641', '29382397', '28249566', '34864856', '26262422', '36416141', '24622773', '32972364', '30567477', '29077847', '18283029', '15826357', '16580973', '33098410', '33936429', '26122527', '25339081', '29728247', '29122011', '26219079', '26347797', '27312781', '24384709', '19909518', '20406505', '30048465', '24928448', '23920963', '37858611', '24158091', '20671315', '30142385', '23785452', '23920797', '35713869', '22392703', '14871877', '27087307', '31568842', '26201478', '28361158', '24489368', '25036529', '28096894', '27695078', '26241355', '26495291', '27278475', '26481140', '34185011', '35713868', '25991100', '21724741', '27081156', '29738537', '29378218', '32335223', '22586067', '26209007', '26925515', '29297359', '25983133', '24637294', '22174296', '29099838', '24278248', '21489220', '35181524', '21096556', '20709188', '32183790', '37482171', '35511112', '32454243', '36932655', '20617200', '32310779', '30296491', '21569604', '30530380', '35616099', '22298565', '20823320', '34987405', '26003938', '23920643', '36449561', '34791012', '22195162', '23920634', '31874609', '21491844', '37168529', '23921192', '34418954', '33266753', '26054024', '30963300', '31686105', '34017245', '35820793', '31863452', '24788261', '31125330', '37484258', '33571676', '37603959', '26210362', '33544847', '35965308', '29854219', '35856889', '29034375', '34003753', '35437468', '32477633', '34541578', '17674621', '24303305', '24303244', '31698234', '35322076', '27525223', '24155869', '30346607', '37302520', '32836102', '35324927', '22347783', '20472411', '37689796', '33954234', '25796619', '38107590', '37632414', '37514010', '37168529', '35856889', '34524450', '34031788', '34017245', '33570092', '33266753', '32984300', '32814201', '31307133', '30671672', '30616557', '30303528', '30105604', '30010731', '29897318', '29763706', '29373599', '29297301', '29077847', '29034375', '29017459', '28748229', '28605776', '28334070', '28228132', '28053977', '27695078', '27630201', '27466626', '26941831', '25796456', '24858490', '29373599', '26941831', '15826357', '16580973', '25796456', '24858490', '29373599', '26941831', '25143286', '27585838', '23906817', '23785452', '23613763', '23133662', '22464129', '22388011', '22151252', '21545845', '21489220', '21170415', '21059682', '20671319', '20617200', '19073593', '19025688', '18244442', '17142812', '16779033', '15561790', '11825149', '25796456', '15826357', '16580973', '31686105', '26210362', '31863452', '24788261', '34003753', '27525223', '25796456', '15826357', '16580973', '31686105', '26210362', '31863452']"
Automated gene expression pattern annotation in the mouse brain.,"Yang, Tao; Zhao, Xinlin; Lin, Binbin; Zeng, Tao; Ji, Shuiwang; Ye, Jieping",No date,"Brain tumor is a fatal central nervous system disease that occurs in around 250,000 people each year globally and it is the second cause of cancer in children. It has been widely acknowledged that genetic factor is one of the significant risk factors for brain cancer. Thus, accurate descriptions of the locations of where the relative genes are active and how these genes express are critical for understanding the pathogenesis of brain tumor and for early detection. The Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas is a project on gene expression over the course of mouse brain development stages. Utilizing mouse models allows us to use a relatively homogeneous system to reveal the genetic risk factor of brain cancer. In the Allen atlas, about 435,000 high-resolution spatiotemporal in situ hybridization images have been generated for approximately 2,100 genes and currently the expression patterns over specific brain regions are manually annotated by experts, which does not scale with the continuously expanding collection of images. In this paper, we present an efficient computational approach to perform automated gene expression pattern annotation on brain images. First, the gene expression information in the brain images is captured by invariant features extracted from local image patches. Next, we adopt an augmented sparse coding method, called Stochastic Coordinate Coding, to construct high-level representations. Different pooling methods are then applied to generate gene-level features. To discriminate gene expression patterns at specific brain regions, we employ supervised learning methods to build accurate models for both binary-class and multi-class cases. Random undersampling and majority voting strategies are utilized to deal with the inherently imbalanced class distribution within each annotation task in order to further improve predictive performance. In addition, we propose a novel structure-based multi-label classification approach, which makes use of label hierarchy based on brain ontology during model learning. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the atlas and results show that the proposed approach produces higher annotation accuracy than several baseline methods. Our approach is shown to be robust on both binary-class and multi-class tasks and even with a relatively low training ratio. Our results also show that the use of label hierarchy can significantly improve the annotation accuracy at all brain ontology levels.",25592576,No DOI,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",No keywords,"Algorithms; Animals; Brain; Brain Neoplasms; Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Humans; In Situ Hybridization; Logistic Models; Mice; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Risk Factors; Stochastic Processes; Supervised Machine Learning","['25592576', '25948335', '28608010', '24299119', '21519115', '15603586', '17437647', '22621237', '28391202', '25843807', '17634097', '15478601', '25425037', '25823003', '16184189', '16728446', '25463474', '14681479', '17237064', '24407304', '24947138', '17646340', '27896977', '12537577', '22689756', '25706271', '17473321', '26724853', '24952961', '17224611', '19733241', '22903005', '30130573', '29321535', '17319737', '30598093', '25592604', '17369647', '12367636', '24723538', '31425122', '26362074', '15774002', '24457510', '25982908', '20005686', '21357576', '30601935', '20134060', '26493682', '18632750', '21814502', '24004696', '17911164', '17151600', '15960828', '23812993', '23892294', '19698790', '26968614', '31100428', '26057591', '15960829', '26890880', '22987132', '26363845', '19383139', '31553718', '31025483', '26786896', '27153655', '30563825', '27896963', '20401950', '29554126', '17666758', '30691040', '27489953', '26693857', '28664394', '18269699', '21121032', '20824158', '23813005', '33266936', '26819407', '11473023', '18625066', '27552746', '32386536', '31404060', '34393747', '29297276', '31138112', '28505320', '30943207', '34280183', '36926884', '11529308', '27896959', '31027180', '30125267', '32448958', '28420888', '19800406', '24579193', '31483788', '26372202', '30872254', '28265788', '27318209', '23118863', '30779021', '21984755', '26296321', '34553213', '21614142', '23845024', '28630769', '25592573', '35542493', '22639262', '28850115', '36877707', '26561477', '17270888', '30629591', '18077470', '15582152', '22106336', '28190221', '22832508', '16602821', '36529023', '28769090', '24040258', '22536893', '33901772', '36107929', '19761564', '21884637', '33051491', '24177753', '20956311', '23386717', '23226299', '36909656', '33625357', '30658497', '12050069', '33076915', '33976144', '27897010', '38150111', '24068900', '18769656', '29994482', '35398971', '22372999', '32372933', '33230549', '24523945', '32937025', '30740605', '26285224', '24904397', '30142956', '31750011', '30254541', '17521453', '36544482', '20631855', '33008305', '20458360', '37885672', '9325120', '24706869', '21347137', '27797513', '18287559', '35664506', '28979827', '19822726', '37798600', '35138913', '37333322', '20628548', '32750346', '37500639', '22298846', '27532065', '27747484', '25852489', '34146633', '25592600', '25592576', '25948335', '28608010', '24299119', '16728446', '12367636', '25592576', '25948335', '28608010', '24299119', '21519115', '15603586', '24176869', '19076777', '16576749', '8637596', '25592576', '16728446', '12367636', '17911164', '11529308', '28265788', '22832508', '22298846', '25592576', '16728446', '12367636', '17911164', '11529308', '28265788']"

Selecting features with group-sparse nonnegative supervised canonical correlation analysis: multimodal prostate cancer prognosis.,"Wang, Haibo; Singanamalli, Asha; Ginsburg, Shoshana; Madabhushi, Anant",No date,"This paper presents Group-sparse Nonnegative supervised Canonical Correlation Analysis (GNCCA), a novel methodology for identifying discriminative features from multiple feature views. Existing correlation-based methods do not guarantee positive correlations of the selected features and often need a pre-feature selection step to reduce redundant features on each feature view. The new GNCCA approach attempts to overcome these issues by incorporating (1) a nonnegativity constraint that guarantees positive correlations in the reduced representation and (2) a group-sparsity constraint that allows for simultaneous between- and within- view feature selection. In particular, GNCCA is designed to emphasize correlations between feature views and class labels such that the selected features guarantee better class separability. In this work, GNCCA was evaluated on three prostate cancer (CaP) prognosis tasks: (i) identifying 40 CaP patients with and without 5-year biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy by fusing quantitative features extracted from digitized pathology and proteomics, (ii) predicting in vivo prostate cancer grade for 16 CaP patients by fusing T2w and DCE MRI, and (iii) localizing CaP/benign regions on MR spectroscopy and MRI for 36 patients. For the three tasks, GNCCA identifies a feature subset comprising 2%, 1% and 22%, respectively, of the original extracted features. These selected features achieve improved or comparable results compared to using all features with the same Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. In addition, GNCCA consistently outperforms 5 state-of-the-art feature selection methods across all three datasets.",25320823,No DOI,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,"Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Male; Microscopy; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Prognosis; Prostatic Neoplasms; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Statistics as Topic","['25320823', '20879557', '22337003', '16350920', '24943647', '20879457', '26362074', '24579146', '23076045', '24505707', '16030375', '25060941', '24464613', '20493759', '24505786', '18979803', '25122849', '23286075', '25485375', '26110513', '17948727', '27990722', '26014883', '18713675', '18390351', '18550907', '17354810', '25203987', '15839268', '16685911', '18939996', '16685822', '17387001', '17243588', '17431299', '24924512', '25333166', '24505794', '15742891', '15751846', '18979734', '17108377', '22566465', '20137998', '20229900', '19110490', '16276498', '25499960', '20426164', '25320818', '26242589', '17093334', '18617713', '20031496', '26455963', '20879324', '26572145', '18270121', '16685993', '26270912', '24972858', '23286183', '22262681', '18432471', '15191295', '23412621', '19000969', '17354824', '17679329', '15742897', '23690210', '24495469', '25333095', '25103878', '22182303', '24505693', '24579174', '17044412', '32361379', '22894488', '25027713', '20879458', '21461364', '23392336', '24348733', '22255811', '19163871', '24982970', '32745975', '31513592', '34458576', '29212759', '31946898', '12590175', '26973368', '31880552', '35058213', '36897911', '26801960', '30441228', '26998311', '34343342', '24489753', '38368275', '34010731', '28056889', '25320823', '20879557', '22337003', '16350920', '24943647', '12590175', '25320823', '20879557', '22337003', '16350920', '24943647', '20879457', '25320823', '12590175', '25320823', '12590175']"
Decision support framework for Parkinson's disease based on novel handwriting markers.,"Drotár, Peter; Mekyska, Jiří; Rektorová, Irena; Masarová, Lucia; Smékal, Zdeněk; Faundez-Zanuy, Marcos",2014-09-25,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which impairs motor skills, speech, and other functions such as behavior, mood, and cognitive processes. One of the most typical clinical hallmarks of PD is handwriting deterioration, usually the first manifestation of PD. The aim of this study is twofold: (a) to find a subset of handwriting features suitable for identifying subjects with PD and (b) to build a predictive model to efficiently diagnose PD. We collected handwriting samples from 37 medicated PD patients and 38 age- and sex-matched controls. The handwriting samples were collected during seven tasks such as writing a syllable, word, or sentence. Every sample was used to extract the handwriting measures. In addition to conventional kinematic and spatio-temporal handwriting measures, we also computed novel handwriting measures based on entropy, signal energy, and empirical mode decomposition of the handwriting signals. The selected features were fed to the support vector machine classifier with radial Gaussian kernel for automated diagnosis. The accuracy of the classification of PD was as high as 88.13%, with the highest values of sensitivity and specificity equal to 89.47% and 91.89%, respectively.

Active data selection for motor imagery EEG classification.,"Tomida, Naoki; Tanaka, Toshihisa; Ono, Shunsuke; Yamagishi, Masao; Higashi, Hiroshi",2014-09-16,"Rejecting or selecting data from multiple trials of electroencephalography (EEG) recordings is crucial. We propose a sparsity-aware method to data selection from a set of multiple EEG recordings during motor-imagery tasks, aiming at brain machine interfaces (BMIs). Instead of empirical averaging over sample covariance matrices for multiple trials including low-quality data, which can lead to poor performance in BMI classification, we introduce weighted averaging with weight coefficients that can reject such trials. The weight coefficients are determined by the l1-minimization problem that lead to sparse weights such that almost zero-values are allocated to low-quality trials. The proposed method was successfully applied for estimating covariance matrices for the so-called common spatial pattern (CSP) method, which is widely used for feature extraction from EEG in the two-class classification. Classification of EEG signals during motor imagery was examined to support the proposed method. It should be noted that the proposed data selection method can be applied to a number of variants of the original CSP method.",25248173,10.1109/TBME.2014.2358536,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,"Brain Mapping; Brain-Computer Interfaces; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials, Motor; Imagination; Motor Cortex; Movement; Nerve Net; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity","['25248173', '25404753', '24599891', '26405916', '23366871', '23536381', '23204288', '25227081', '23751454', '26271130', '27542114', '19605314', '22010143', '26302519', '17946051', '17946093', '27392361', '25834118', '22287252', '24723632', '22431526', '16510942', '25474811', '18002686', '21096242', '16921207', '25242018', '19162733', '16003895', '17409476', '23446029', '25227000', '25122834', '23574821', '17601202', '25986750', '27900952', '25845481', '19963715', '21436518', '18002657', '23843600', '25226998', '28238175', '26955040', '17409486', '24737062', '26277421', '19162832', '19285139', '23676901', '28961119', '19162856', '27795702', '30699389', '19963466', '21436539', '15218939', '17946524', '19162827', '29100117', '18403281', '21436530', '18003147', '27377661', '24737114', '31141703', '21478575', '28055887', '22348825', '19162735', '15876616', '22872668', '18701380', '18714838', '21096013', '17945624', '16317229', '24048242', '18232371', '28012854', '16921204', '28161876', '23639955', '15188873', '21436533', '16602570', '28410052', '26176364', '22255731', '15188883', '12899254', '23475381', '22949044', '17945723', '24302929', '23204287', '24751647', '28220764', '16317224', '29737970', '25747342', '17946448', '20850237', '26405870', '19964437', '20571185', '17946502', '27849544', '15188882', '18756030', '26353236', '26305233', '17945704', '26452197', '21097232', '27681162', '30334800', '21096852', '16967290', '26305124', '31476743', '17945570', '19413908', '21096006', '31683268', '26372428', '24949558', '28663052', '28096809', '25504690', '31095507', '28891513', '29096552', '22255564', '25488924', '31585454', '28516901', '24111370', '21478573', '30883278', '29080913', '25933101', '33788862', '25982878', '23366828', '30050566', '17946469', '34891438', '28269588', '27313656', '31947254', '28715332', '26276986', '27834647', '30990183', '31946539', '23578057', '22255470', '25915773', '29747059', '15876632', '31478864', '23366872', '7833692', '24496497', '30440375', '31677441', '21436529', '26336136', '31946010', '18003216', '27323368', '27323367', '16898656', '20449765', '27259085', '31946530', '25014972', '17945614', '30181429', '25571487', '25546485', '19964435', '29446587', '27891256', '29348744', '21096012', '33770779', '28129143', '25570047', '21096615', '28091395', '19163107', '33628220', '26602980', '23953939', '33017963', '28269289', '32309055', '19965060', '28269587', '23281484', '28113609', '31594269', '27746229', '32018159', '23366954', '32161520', '30853905', '31575147', '23502973', '25893019', '17281466', '14611622', '24043195', '29867307', '29616456', '29423352', '29297303', '29225615', '27458376', '25248173', '25404753', '24599891', '26405916', '28055887', '23639955', '25248173', '25404753', '24599891', '26405916', '23366871', '23536381', '25248173', '28055887', '23639955', '26602980', '33017963', '25248173', '28055887', '23639955', '26602980', '33017963']"
A generic approach to pathological lung segmentation.,"Mansoor, Awais; Bagci, Ulas; Xu, Ziyue; Foster, Brent; Olivier, Kenneth N; Elinoff, Jason M; Suffredini, Anthony F; Udupa, Jayaram K; Mollura, Daniel J",2014-07-08,"In this study, we propose a novel pathological lung segmentation method that takes into account neighbor prior constraints and a novel pathology recognition system. Our proposed framework has two stages; during stage one, we adapted the fuzzy connectedness (FC) image segmentation algorithm to perform initial lung parenchyma extraction. In parallel, we estimate the lung volume using rib-cage information without explicitly delineating lungs. This rudimentary, but intelligent lung volume estimation system allows comparison of volume differences between rib cage and FC based lung volume measurements. Significant volume difference indicates the presence of pathology, which invokes the second stage of the proposed framework for the refinement of segmented lung. In stage two, texture-based features are utilized to detect abnormal imaging patterns (consolidations, ground glass, interstitial thickening, tree-inbud, honeycombing, nodules, and micro-nodules) that might have been missed during the first stage of the algorithm. This refinement stage is further completed by a novel neighboring anatomy-guided segmentation approach to include abnormalities with weak textures, and pleura regions. We evaluated the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method on more than 400 CT scans with the presence of a wide spectrum of abnormalities. To our best of knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate all abnormal imaging patterns in a single segmentation framework. The quantitative results show that our pathological lung segmentation method improves on current standards because of its high sensitivity and specificity and may have considerable potential to enhance the performance of routine clinical tasks.",25020069,10.1109/TMI.2014.2337057,pubmed,Journal Article,No keywords,"Adult; Aged; Algorithms; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Young Adult","['25020069', '26133591', '25571372', '19928090', '21317088', '19175088', '24320475', '17574128', '19906596', '19059759', '26026778', '23927326', '24835182', '26256737', '27150553', '22320783', '16092334', '23556926', '25791434', '29080491', '21914567', '16321738', '28705410', '21997248', '16353370', '31788807', '25086546', '25333193', '30602393', '31319957', '26055544', '25971587', '16398410', '23053904', '23020972', '10757610', '25173811', '27532214', '26172351', '19864701', '25570597', '19163592', '18515044', '20384268', '25281960', '28321787', '32750948', '29496080', '26336121', '23920933', '31435950', '22320795', '27796791', '29852959', '23879987', '29286609', '27635395', '18044569', '17521085', '17126065', '26961983', '19673192', '26936732', '23062953', '26356850', '20615804', '25113321', '27447897', '27659283', '20346728', '25186393', '17500464', '21071791', '30614020', '24703476', '18051073', '25888834', '16898434', '17198346', '21096807', '24211937', '17390986', '32034633', '31940114', '16807062', '38228773', '25832038', '21486712', '15822807', '18418597', '25640150', '26576926', '15350582', '20457415', '18390344', '19826872', '16683082', '19203878', '35653902', '29955159', '38082954', '25546346', '38249785', '38017029', '37576094', '36854040', '35885454', '35406614', '35371290', '35197542', '35185592', '34450923', '34266391', '34261743', '34188605', '34146799', '33275187', '33246227', '32971995', '32814998', '32749075', '32556911', '32303861', '30840717', '30602393', '29995646', '29955159', '29559307', '29331208', '28856247', '28749127', '28388650', '28203447', '27635395', '27447897', '26835492', '26828465', '26218507', '26172351', '26133591', '25546346', '25020069', '26133591', '25571372', '19928090', '21317088', '26172351', '25020069', '26133591', '25571372', '19928090', '21317088', '19175088', '25571373', '25570597', '24320475', '23879987', '23372069', '23340591', '22434795', '22311862', '22271834', '22238625', '22203704', '22003757', '21997248', '21928634', '21723090', '21295734', '20879449', '20129855', '19928090', '19234255', '18692759', '18515044', '18496044', '18195376', '18002992', '17521085', '16898465', '16608061', '16398410', '16092334', '16087093', '15798068', '15350582', '15269018', '12774894', '12643552', '9874837', '9533583', '1987199', '25020069', '26172351', '25020069', '26172351']"
USB: ultrashort binary descriptor for fast visual matching and retrieval.,"Zhang, Shiliang; Tian, Qi; Huang, Qingming; Gao, Wen; Rui, Yong",2014-06-12,"Currently, many local descriptors have been proposed to tackle a basic issue in computer vision: duplicate visual content matching. These descriptors either are represented as high-dimensional vectors relatively expensive to extract and compare or are binary codes limited in robustness. Bag-of-visual words (BoWs) model compresses local features into a compact representation that allows for fast matching and scalable indexing. However, the codebook training, high-dimensional feature extraction, and quantization significantly degrade the flexibility and efficiency of BoWs model. In this paper, we study an alternative to current local descriptors and BoWs model by extracting the ultrashort binary descriptor (USB) and a compact auxiliary spatial feature from each keypoint detected in images. A typical USB is a 24-bit binary descriptor, hence it directly quantizes visual clues of image keypoints to about 16 million unique IDs. USB allows fast image matching and indexing and avoids the expensive codebook training and feature quantization in BoWs model. The spatial feature complementarily captures the spatial configuration in neighbor region of each keypoint, hence is used to filter mismatched USBs in a cascade verification. In image matching task, USB shows promising accuracy and nearly one-order faster speed than SIFT. We also test USB in retrieval tasks on UKbench, Oxford5K, and 1.2 million distractor images. Comparisons with recent retrieval methods manifest the competitive accuracy, memory consumption, and significantly better efficiency of our approach.",24951701,10.1109/TIP.2014.2330794,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,"Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","['24951701', '24951697', '22128004', '17108377', '15688565', '24951691', '17170486', '28542537', '16285381', '16526427', '16285372', '19372614', '15641740', '22566465', '15641722', '16119265', '16173186', '20071259', '15742898', '17627045', '17699925', '15382655', '15641723', '15628276', '18390374', '23204286', '15376889', '15641725', '17093334', '17224614', '16526423', '16640271', '22353403', '19762928', '20479491', '18550908', '16355664', '23481859', '15495304', '15641731', '17431296', '23076045', '15943431', '23144034', '15376886', '15794136', '22249710', '15376894', '19110488', '15943430', '15688562', '16237996', '29372327', '17848775', '15641739', '16237991', '18037271', '26074952', '25203990', '17688208', '24919200', '17022260', '17926703', '15376601', '23267200', '16602600', '29883455', '17390989', '16722173', '26656584', '29031966', '16121457', '20224132', '27315101', '26571531', '29694429', '26140348', '29455260', '28783503', '25320818', '23467056', '16674210', '25488214', '25226987', '16900695', '30689441', '26415151', '24977215', '19435524', '32479504', '25258644', '29086034', '21576750', '29993412', '26340256', '31104711', '25398187', '34042625', '25991105', '29993880', '18186597', '18344220', '24163631', '21800188', '28577174', '31121417', '28534775', '29105019', '29260348', '21822675', '22163524', '26415174', '28840386', '21646678', '21266047', '33735082', '26352453', '24511326', '27046897', '24759989', '26353223', '29993689', '31251186', '27662689', '20542765', '19083036', '28484919', '30738189', '26353063', '20100674', '27058283', '28650798', '28268541', '26353235', '25112715', '27416596', '33438641', '29574350', '30475737', '26357303', '26539859', '26292340', '28880176', '26353264', '25485414', '29190737', '33913378', '28293255', '24520346', '34579324', '36772705', '26718556', '30605474', '28796611', '28320662', '28219745', '34453284', '24110537', '19775970', '22692772', '36298100', '30990451', '28114059', '29733272', '38067852', '22773049', '37447657', '26540688', '25051551', '25222732', '22084141', '26270906', '26099150', '25119982', '31217801', '26958280', '26121038', '25930712', '32976101', '30646611', '34833763', '32400712', '37299906', '33236924', '25164175', '29068358', '25769164', '32589586', '29994561', '28092549', '11341567', '25571025', '37622168', '28682253', '28459683', '27875223', '24892288', '37092391', '30235113', '29904005', '30040626', '32502224', '30004415', '34460461', '29597331', '33299393', '25137734', '23919138', '27164564', '29914068', '26656952', '26440272', '31940574', '26353295', '35830407', '21912534', '29698208', '28358674', '30428580', '26571542', '26441449', '28680458', '30047879', '28628783', '30668474', '25794407', '38339570', '37836972', '26625422', '32850176', '29495416', '34577242', '28251648', '34951846', '33800746', '31947459', '36873380', '36015753', '28749362', '9228574', '27019477', '37256030', '36560267', '35320089', '26731637', '33095712', '35242945', '34940745', '28003793', '31976904', '29969394', '21173449', '26736361', '30714921', '32911656', '26353288', '12638013', '27723578', '34288871', '38036564', '33186112', '25105164', '30132895', '27608464', '26394424', '18244480', '32075119', '34904758', '26742133', '31944973', '26321859', '35135220', '27046497', '30843838', '28212085', '25903323', '36121963', '28420155', '35800689', '28531101', '32784921', '27448341', '27429886', '27656199', '26730398', '30703019', '31449018', '31869788', '32759084', '35875652', '25122835', '26353274', '25314718', '22164022', '30281450', '31013282', '37768387', '31137497', '32759732', '35471275', '19546918', '37717259', '28420142', '29652805', '31547572', '27828148', '28436869', '29481548', '34065726', '32727159', '28333620', '26736379', '26007729', '36136747', '26571532', '31722477', '26357346', '35967610', '34460762', '28718907', '21868946', '27532065', '23145308', '21869095', '9938052', '27569874', '27569872', '24951701', '24951697', '22128004', '17108377', '15688565', '31976904', '24951701', '24951697', '22128004', '17108377', '15688565', '24951691', '24951701', '31976904', '24951701', '31976904']"
A SVM-based quantitative fMRI method for resting-state functional network detection.,"Song, Xiaomu; Chen, Nan-kuei",2014-04-13,"Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) aims to measure baseline neuronal connectivity independent of specific functional tasks and to capture changes in the connectivity due to neurological diseases. Most existing network detection methods rely on a fixed threshold to identify functionally connected voxels under the resting state. Due to fMRI non-stationarity, the threshold cannot adapt to variation of data characteristics across sessions and subjects, and generates unreliable mapping results. In this study, a new method is presented for resting-state fMRI data analysis. Specifically, the resting-state network mapping is formulated as an outlier detection process that is implemented using one-class support vector machine (SVM). The results are refined by using a spatial-feature domain prototype selection method and two-class SVM reclassification. The final decision on each voxel is made by comparing its probabilities of functionally connected and unconnected instead of a threshold. Multiple features for resting-state analysis were extracted and examined using an SVM-based feature selection method, and the most representative features were identified. The proposed method was evaluated using synthetic and experimental fMRI data. A comparison study was also performed with independent component analysis (ICA) and correlation analysis. The experimental results show that the proposed method can provide comparable or better network detection performance than ICA and correlation analysis.

Advancing bag-of-visual-words representations for lesion classification in retinal images.,"Pires, Ramon; Jelinek, Herbert F; Wainer, Jacques; Valle, Eduardo; Rocha, Anderson",2014-06-02,"Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a complication of diabetes that can lead to blindness if not readily discovered. Automated screening algorithms have the potential to improve identification of patients who need further medical attention. However, the identification of lesions must be accurate to be useful for clinical application. The bag-of-visual-words (BoVW) algorithm employs a maximum-margin classifier in a flexible framework that is able to detect the most common DR-related lesions such as microaneurysms, cotton-wool spots and hard exudates. BoVW allows to bypass the need for pre- and post-processing of the retinographic images, as well as the need of specific ad hoc techniques for identification of each type of lesion. An extensive evaluation of the BoVW model, using three large retinograph datasets (DR1, DR2 and Messidor) with different resolution and collected by different healthcare personnel, was performed. The results demonstrate that the BoVW classification approach can identify different lesions within an image without having to utilize different algorithms for each lesion reducing processing time and providing a more flexible diagnostic system. Our BoVW scheme is based on sparse low-level feature detection with a Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) local descriptor, and mid-level features based on semi-soft coding with max pooling. The best BoVW representation for retinal image classification was an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 97.8% (exudates) and 93.5% (red lesions), applying a cross-dataset validation protocol. To assess the accuracy for detecting cases that require referral within one year, the sparse extraction technique associated with semi-soft coding and max pooling obtained an AUC of 94.2 ± 2.0%, outperforming current methods. Those results indicate that, for retinal image classification tasks in clinical practice, BoVW is equal and, in some instances, surpasses results obtained using dense detection (widely believed to be the best choice in many vision problems) for the low-level descriptors.",24886780,10.1371/journal.pone.0096814,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,Algorithms; Area Under Curve; Databases as Topic; Decision Making; Diabetic Retinopathy; Humans; Reference Standards; Retinal Diseases,"['24886780', '23963192', '22665502', '25569918', '17460289', '30055096', '36425113', '28359545', '21757250', '24480176', '25935125', '29105019', '22781265', '31281057', '34050158', '31144041', '26561488', '32648111', '21292586', '22090037', '26035836', '18003122', '32855845', '32295576', '21901535', '28511066', '31164214', '12556411', '32069912', '25822397', '22961609', '27608447', '29124453', '32092614', '27908249', '31957737', '19539518', '20399502', '26372661', '20703589', '26378502', '27898976', '29864167', '36733744', '33398790', '32502224', '28353133', '29178249', '15627932', '29234807', '36772705', '30447130', '25192577', '30610422', '28269002', '31323065', '28926199', '10837904', '26231313', '31932886', '30237145', '30677193', '31014679', '34330270', '26895509', '19430906', '21666234', '27060730', '19586814', '31093787', '28786703', '31606110', '29372258', '29694429', '32904519', '29548646', '32166636', '32880609', '26737577', '30308336', '34488028', '20129850', '20219404', '31469507', '27393810', '11874425', '30809539', '29883455', '31416547', '15955976', '34376678', '31144148', '22255763', '29157445', '23366177', '1547965', '31747632', '36310481', '35052803', '37026019', '35607469', '35368859', '32283816', '36574416', '37120993', '25566044', '38222329', '37667028', '37532460', '37296756', '37240693', '34980281', '34859116', '34696149', '34476169', '34460801', '34362989', '28353133', '27231583', '26830491', '26035836', '24886780', '23963192', '22665502', '25569918', '17460289', '32166636', '24886780', '23963192', '22665502', '25569918', '17460289', '30055096', '23963192', '23494039', '23192523', '22665502', '22481810', '22255695', '22255692', '22167598', '21865074', '21819244', '20489229', '19954928', '19661069', '19623908', '19539518', '18930631', '18461814', '18065845', '18024852', '17460289', '17003294', '16967807', '16967806', '16907667', '13129860', '11874425', '9744903', '2916977', '2062513', '24886780', '32166636', '24886780', '32166636']"
A novel feature selection strategy for enhanced biomedical event extraction using the Turku system.,"Xia, Jingbo; Fang, Alex Chengyu; Zhang, Xing",2014-04-06,"Feature selection is of paramount importance for text-mining classifiers with high-dimensional features. The Turku Event Extraction System (TEES) is the best performing tool in the GENIA BioNLP 2009/2011 shared tasks, which relies heavily on high-dimensional features. This paper describes research which, based on an implementation of an accumulated effect evaluation (AEE) algorithm applying the greedy search strategy, analyses the contribution of every single feature class in TEES with a view to identify important features and modify the feature set accordingly. With an updated feature set, a new system is acquired with enhanced performance which achieves an increased F-score of 53.27% up from 51.21% for Task 1 under strict evaluation criteria and 57.24% according to the approximate span and recursive criterion.",24800214,10.1155/2014/205239,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,"Abstracting and Indexing; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Data Mining; Natural Language Processing; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Semantics; Vocabulary, Controlled","['24800214', '24729964', '14871877', '23920797', '23920963', '15180929', '17946134', '24551397', '22759458', '25385082', '15826357', '16504116', '24694772', '29122011', '26551925', '15814561', '24858490', '18998798', '18547432', '30576489', '25796456', '17977867', '21887336', '30183643', '16112894', '25149151', '18998821', '18586724', '18999194', '30576491', '26547986', '30367569', '18426550', '16986547', '21508414', '19783830', '22584238', '24384709', '22595089', '26941831', '16438716', '18998786', '24850848', '22195224', '23920967', '19025692', '23920842', '17134476', '18998881', '15462433', '19025687', '25559746', '26305514', '25309952', '23920672', '26231070', '23920587', '23566040', '23920664', '14759820', '20709188', '24551371', '25510606', '23920827', '20371168', '18400773', '18460187', '26495291', '25160253', '14615225', '26336667', '15308538', '21096556', '23920620', '21613640', '19166973', '25946862', '20841735', '26209007', '18426549', '16580973', '22922172', '19006447', '25160354', '12584127', '17134478', '27454611', '26133479', '21709163', '26761536', '26122527', '15728115', '26315662', '18426548', '22841748', '18998930', '16095962', '20351910', '18999152', '22586067', '20823321', '25560088', '23920514', '26202570', '34142969', '30294517', '26587051', '26551925', '24800214', '24729964', '14871877', '23920797', '15826357', '17977867', '24800214', '24729964', '14871877', '23920797', '23920963', '15180929', '24564647', '24496068', '24464286', '24459452', '24448204', '24371834', '24288684', '24078912', '23586054', '22759458', '21413920', '20823321', '18182099', '24800214', '15826357', '17977867', '17134478', '16580973', '26761536', '24800214', '15826357', '17977867', '17134478', '16580973', '26761536']"
Evaluating word representation features in biomedical named entity recognition tasks.,"Tang, Buzhou; Cao, Hongxin; Wang, Xiaolong; Chen, Qingcai; Xu, Hua",2014-03-06,"Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BNER), which extracts important entities such as genes and proteins, is a crucial step of natural language processing in the biomedical domain. Various machine learning-based approaches have been applied to BNER tasks and showed good performance. In this paper, we systematically investigated three different types of word representation (WR) features for BNER, including clustering-based representation, distributional representation, and word embeddings. We selected one algorithm from each of the three types of WR features and applied them to the JNLPBA and BioCreAtIvE II BNER tasks. Our results showed that all the three WR algorithms were beneficial to machine learning-based BNER systems. Moreover, combining these different types of WR features further improved BNER performance, indicating that they are complementary to each other. By combining all the three types of WR features, the improvements in F-measure on the BioCreAtIvE II GM and JNLPBA corpora were 3.75% and 1.39%, respectively, when compared with the systems using baseline features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically evaluate the effect of three different types of WR features for BNER tasks.",24729964,10.1155/2014/240403,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,"Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Biomedical Research; Data Mining; MEDLINE; Natural Language Processing; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Semantics; Terminology as Topic; Vocabulary, Controlled","['24729964', '23566040', '16504116', '29084508', '28502909', '29122011', '32602538', '26547986', '15814561', '19074302', '30183643', '18426548', '23920963', '24800214', '21508414', '25510606', '25385082', '37174810', '27087307', '26336667', '14871877', '18999272', '23920797', '17239841', '16822321', '26958273', '23920842', '18433469', '30217670', '18998821', '25946862', '18998881', '18999292', '20876938', '26004792', '16539745', '20371168', '18426549', '34001263', '28328252', '25559746', '18272430', '24393765', '26390497', '29935347', '27127603', '26305514', '22085698', '29029598', '31076572', '25810779', '23920967', '25755127', '16580973', '17134477', '17254295', '15826357', '25160253', '29868832', '30917789', '19025694', '24694772', '26262126', '32324731', '26262393', '20053840', '24347408', '18999200', '23954592', '23304311', '21092226', '17238442', '19025692', '25879978', '31627150', '22874171', '19006447', '26219079', '38007808', '18426550', '12761055', '31566474', '23920587', '23666409', '16438716', '17134475', '24858490', '27777244', '15728115', '26671801', '29538614', '18426551', '18426547', '37038786', '18998930', '16466569', '31200909', '16112894', '33817030', '26231070', '25560088', '25343498', '36621289', '18426546', '29329435', '26210359', '25309952', '24977198', '24459452', '31419937', '28369171', '36755230', '33974546', '23920514', '24991639', '24973735', '29490008', '24124474', '36560177', '37188766', '35773865', '34173249', '25861377', '26054024', '35798258', '35951425', '24155869', '34920128', '36085310', '33742785', '36329384', '35252956', '34920699', '34888523', '34653224', '33809188', '32984300', '32958982', '32477672', '31825016', '31769759', '31015858', '30944913', '30616584', '30498741', '30217670', '30076490', '29854252', '29618526', '29329435', '29297321', '29084508', '28881963', '28830409', '28684255', '28379377', '28267590', '28200120', '27903489', '27087307', '26958273', '26122526', '25810779', '24729964', '23566040', '16504116', '29084508', '37174810', '16580973', '24729964', '23566040', '16504116', '29084508', '28502909', '29122011', '23571849', '18834493', '16420734', '16267085', '15516276', '14681409', '11072323', '9697224', '24729964', '37174810', '16580973', '15826357', '34173249', '24729964', '37174810', '16580973', '15826357', '34173249']"
A statistical approach to set classification by feature selection with applications to classification of histopathology images.,"Jung, Sungkyu; Qiao, Xingye",2014-03-03,"Set classification problems arise when classification tasks are based on sets of observations as opposed to individual observations. In set classification, a classification rule is trained with N sets of observations, where each set is labeled with class information, and the prediction of a class label is performed also with a set of observations. Data sets for set classification appear, for example, in diagnostics of disease based on multiple cell nucleus images from a single tissue. Relevant statistical models for set classification are introduced, which motivate a set classification framework based on context-free feature extraction. By understanding a set of observations as an empirical distribution, we employ a data-driven method to choose those features which contain information on location and major variation. In particular, the method of principal component analysis is used to extract the features of major variation. Multidimensional scaling is used to represent features as vector-valued points on which conventional classifiers can be applied. The proposed set classification approaches achieve better classification results than competing methods in a number of simulated data examples. The benefits of our method are demonstrated in an analysis of histopathology images of cell nuclei related to liver cancer.",24588775,10.1111/biom.12164,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",Bioinformatics; Canonical angles; Discriminant analysis; Hotelling's T‐square; Multidimensional scaling; Principal component analysis; Set classification,"Algorithms; Biopsy; Cell Nucleus; Computer Simulation; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Liver Neoplasms; Microscopy; Models, Statistical; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity","['24588775', '17431299', '17699927', '19110490', '24705202', '25498246', '18713675', '14719689', '22049357', '24579172', '25499960', '23674412', '20977984', '23204283', '25442055', '24495469', '24474370', '22086502', '24637156', '18550907', '16566507', '15742897', '19762929', '24008033', '24579146', '18432467', '24976104', '24051727', '18784026', '20624709', '24710403', '23796718', '15338732', '25042602', '16886863', '17627054', '18617720', '21129881', '22334004', '17699917', '17263881', '20044236', '16526421', '24158477', '20923738', '17431304', '18390358', '17431294', '18270121', '20106740', '19147883', '18432471', '24505794', '24579167', '25044756', '26405883', '27022407', '23366904', '18939996', '17521086', '24579128', '21761673', '17634098', '29250538', '25027713', '27563344', '17578580', '22197442', '29994380', '28186876', '30515200', '25371701', '32691405', '26176839', '22254257', '19216343', '20734222', '26099150', '22255852', '20007045', '30277033', '29164340', '30865639', '19965003', '27996084', '20701090', '31840051', '25685143', '29161187', '9692681', '24778600', '24108352', '18255721', '31762476', '25095276', '26366136', '33716477', '24910485', '20161009', '12746151', '21868992', '20037634', '31983868', '31402834', '24588775', '17431299', '17699927', '19110490', '18784026', '9692681', '24588775', '17431299', '17699927', '19110490', '24705202', '25498246', '24588775', '18784026', '9692681', '24588775', '18784026', '9692681']"
SIMAP--the database of all-against-all protein sequence similarities and annotations with new interfaces and increased coverage.,"Arnold, Roland; Goldenberg, Florian; Mewes, Hans-Werner; Rattei, Thomas",2013-10-27,"The Similarity Matrix of Proteins (SIMAP, http://mips.gsf.de/simap/) database has been designed to massively accelerate computationally expensive protein sequence analysis tasks in bioinformatics. It provides pre-calculated sequence similarities interconnecting the entire known protein sequence universe, complemented by pre-calculated protein features and domains, similarity clusters and functional annotations. SIMAP covers all major public protein databases as well as many consistently re-annotated metagenomes from different repositories. As of September 2013, SIMAP contains >163 million proteins corresponding to ∼70 million non-redundant sequences. SIMAP uses the sensitive FASTA search heuristics, the Smith-Waterman alignment algorithm, the InterPro database of protein domain models and the BLAST2GO functional annotation algorithm. SIMAP assists biologists by facilitating the interactive exploration of the protein sequence universe. Web-Service and DAS interfaces allow connecting SIMAP with any other bioinformatic tool and resource. All-against-all protein sequence similarity matrices of project-specific protein collections are generated on request. Recent improvements allow SIMAP to cover the rapidly growing sequenced protein sequence universe. New Web-Service interfaces enhance the connectivity of SIMAP. Novel tools for interactive extraction of protein similarity networks have been added.

PREDOSE: a semantic web platform for drug abuse epidemiology using social media.,"Cameron, Delroy; Smith, Gary A; Daniulaityte, Raminta; Sheth, Amit P; Dave, Drashti; Chen, Lu; Anand, Gaurish; Carlson, Robert; Watkins, Kera Z; Falck, Russel",2013-07-25,"The role of social media in biomedical knowledge mining, including clinical, medical and healthcare informatics, prescription drug abuse epidemiology and drug pharmacology, has become increasingly significant in recent years. Social media offers opportunities for people to share opinions and experiences freely in online communities, which may contribute information beyond the knowledge of domain professionals. This paper describes the development of a novel semantic web platform called PREDOSE (PREscription Drug abuse Online Surveillance and Epidemiology), which is designed to facilitate the epidemiologic study of prescription (and related) drug abuse practices using social media. PREDOSE uses web forum posts and domain knowledge, modeled in a manually created Drug Abuse Ontology (DAO--pronounced dow), to facilitate the extraction of semantic information from User Generated Content (UGC), through combination of lexical, pattern-based and semantics-based techniques. In a previous study, PREDOSE was used to obtain the datasets from which new knowledge in drug abuse research was derived. Here, we report on various platform enhancements, including an updated DAO, new components for relationship and triple extraction, and tools for content analysis, trend detection and emerging patterns exploration, which enhance the capabilities of the PREDOSE platform. Given these enhancements, PREDOSE is now more equipped to impact drug abuse research by alleviating traditional labor-intensive content analysis

Rotation covariant image processing for biomedical applications.,"Skibbe, Henrik; Reisert, Marco",2013-04-18,"With the advent of novel biomedical 3D image acquisition techniques, the efficient and reliable analysis of volumetric images has become more and more important. The amount of data is enormous and demands an automated processing. The applications are manifold, ranging from image enhancement, image reconstruction, and image description to object/feature detection and high-level contextual feature extraction. In most scenarios, it is expected that geometric transformations alter the output in a mathematically well-defined manner. In this paper we emphasis on 3D translations and rotations. Many algorithms rely on intensity or low-order tensorial-like descriptions to fulfill this demand. This paper proposes a general mathematical framework based on mathematical concepts and theories transferred from mathematical physics and harmonic analysis into the domain of image analysis and pattern recognition. Based on two basic operations, spherical tensor differentiation and spherical tensor multiplication, we show how to design a variety of 3D image processing methods in an efficient way. The framework has already been applied to several biomedical applications ranging from feature and object detection tasks to image enhancement and image restoration techniques. In this paper, the proposed methods are applied on a variety of different 3D data modalities stemming from medical and biological sciences.",23710255,10.1155/2013/931507,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,"Algorithms; Brain; Computational Biology; Fourier Analysis; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Models, Statistical; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Rotation; Support Vector Machine","['23710255', '18239698', '19574630', '15984685', '18989021', '24090164', '36501912', '16526434', '26539244', '20426049', '21088315', '26211811', '24469960', '17496379', '16526422', '24505798', '22203712', '19694261', '20634555', '22225322', '18982589', '17108388', '16355655', '23188268', '22201055', '17299224', '21414834', '23187517', '20879302', '16792105', '15943422', '23820390', '15688567', '21690014', '16625918', '20724753', '18464920', '22086501', '26656587', '18979836', '15747796', '26498516', '18270111', '15850115', '26355329', '20579930', '29877439', '17356208', '19694253', '23107190', '19755205', '20426040', '25086554', '18982711', '15943427', '15488751', '19029555', '18195443', '18002403', '20714011', '25465067', '16685830', '19664714', '24231667', '24505694', '19762926', '20144190', '21172751', '16358381', '20426123', '18982588', '19163936', '30195427', '19163354', '16355666', '17108376', '21995018', '27207363', '19163935', '20426001', '21118771', '18051040', '17496378', '34055040', '23168165', '19163527', '18383676', '20733218', '20426061', '18852735', '15598449', '24579194', '18003385', '19694281', '25333122', '18002149', '16402624', '25415944', '34917163', '35342283', '38102110', '23645963', '25404999', '23710255', '18239698', '19574630', '15984685', '15488751', '24231667', '23710255', '18239698', '19574630', '15984685', '18989021', '24090164', '22201055', '20854913', '20529733', '19285561', '17946853', '15493695', '23710255', '15488751', '24231667', '27207363', '23710255', '15488751', '24231667', '27207363']"

Recognizing clinical entities in hospital discharge summaries using Structural Support Vector Machines with word representation features.,"Tang, Buzhou; Cao, Hongxin; Wu, Yonghui; Jiang, Min; Xu, Hua",2013-04-05,"Named entity recognition (NER) is an important task in clinical natural language processing (NLP) research. Machine learning (ML) based NER methods have shown good performance in recognizing entities in clinical text. Algorithms and features are two important factors that largely affect the performance of ML-based NER systems. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), a sequential labelling algorithm, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), which is based on large margin theory, are two typical machine learning algorithms that have been widely applied to clinical NER tasks. For features, syntactic and semantic information of context words has often been used in clinical NER systems. However, Structural Support Vector Machines (SSVMs), an algorithm that combines the advantages of both CRFs and SVMs, and word representation features, which contain word-level back-off information over large unlabelled corpus by unsupervised algorithms, have not been extensively investigated for clinical text processing. Therefore, the primary goal of this study is to evaluate the use of SSVMs and word representation features in clinical NER tasks.",23566040,10.1186/1472-6947-13-S1-S1,pubmed,"Comparative Study;

Fingerprint identification using SIFT-based minutia descriptors and improved all descriptor-pair matching.,"Zhou, Ru; Zhong, Dexing; Han, Jiuqiang",2013-03-06,"The performance of conventional minutiae-based fingerprint authentication algorithms degrades significantly when dealing with low quality fingerprints with lots of cuts or scratches. A similar degradation of the minutiae-based algorithms is observed when small overlapping areas appear because of the quite narrow width of the sensors. Based on the detection of minutiae, Scale Invariant Feature Transformation (SIFT) descriptors are employed to fulfill verification tasks in the above difficult scenarios. However, the original SIFT algorithm is not suitable for fingerprint because of: (1) the similar patterns of parallel ridges; and (2) high computational resource consumption. To enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm for fingerprint verification, we propose a SIFT-based Minutia Descriptor (SMD) to improve the SIFT algorithm through image processing, descriptor extraction and matcher. A two-step fast matcher, named improved All Descriptor-Pair Matching (iADM), is also proposed to implement the 1:N verifications in real-time. Fingerprint Identification using SMD and iADM (FISiA) achieved a significant improvement with respect to accuracy in representative databases compared with the conventional minutiae-based method. The speed of FISiA also can meet real-time requirements.",23467056,10.3390/s130303142,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,"Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Biometry; Dermatoglyphics; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Pattern Recognition, Automated","['23467056', '17926703', '16724581', '18270124', '17299213', '17702294', '36513184', '17926702', '19414288', '22737016', '23969380', '15751846', '16830915', '17108380', '19372608', '16764292', '30285765', '21088321', '28542537', '38276355', '25822489', '16671291', '12964213', '21193805', '33501354', '20975113', '23144031', '23938559', '21808092', '25873989', '24951701', '24002001', '16402616', '26367052', '17627039', '17299215', '21173446', '26844544', '26352236', '25835186', '16519361', '22328180', '17365425', '17151765', '16237996', '16402615', '29791890', '15648872', '24008283', '36739852', '17299214', '22103733', '15751845', '22287239', '33371876', '21800188', '21088320', '17926721', '29372327', '15747798', '18270094', '17018250', '25105165', '18255456', '17199611', '27315101', '26353269', '26353151', '24951697', '26140348', '22156103', '29574350', '20173871', '17848775', '18421101', '20842841', '33501279', '17299225', '18195445', '20224132', '23481859', '12576112', '35969569', '22654483', '15462145', '20299707', '22875247', '19435524', '18617711', '25203990', '21878416', '34042625', '36536631', '25236929', '17946463', '19762928', '17209910', '24196860', '37972027', '36298100', '22438735', '17356203', '22201055', '20640806', '16914278', '17108377', '25047216', '19443922', '37143776', '37360315', '37092391', '36365934', '24866176', '37666967', '36146321', '24788812', '23509601', '38175842', '31567073', '21146337', '34394892', '37723644', '26397817', '38215200', '36015753', '25372036', '23919138', '23865940', '37018265', '37018679', '35242022', '32836652', '38357591', '37871036', '36981418', '37072451', '37556340', '37022868', '37299906', '24605065', '37814901', '37050799', '35896949', '36451077', '37622182', '34903009', '38234251', '37566574', '34913636', '36175477', '35320089', '34460762', '37432800', '35967610', '36646844', '29597283', '27171091', '24960081', '23467056', '17926703', '16724581', '18270124', '17299213', '35896949', '23467056', '17926703', '16724581', '18270124', '17299213', '17702294', '23467056', '35896949', '23467056', '35896949']"
High-density surface EMG maps from upper-arm and forearm muscles.,"Rojas-Martínez, Monica; Mañanas, Miguel A; Alonso, Joan F",2012-12-10,"sEMG signal has been widely used in different applications in kinesiology and rehabilitation as well as in the control of human-machine interfaces. In general, the signals are recorded with bipolar electrodes located in different muscles. However, such configuration may disregard some aspects of the spatial distribution of the potentials like location of innervation zones and the manifestation of inhomogineties in the control of the muscular fibers. On the other hand, the spatial distribution of motor unit action potentials has recently been assessed with activation maps obtained from High Density EMG signals (HD-EMG), these lasts recorded with arrays of closely spaced electrodes. The main objective of this work is to analyze patterns in the activation maps, associating them with four movement directions at the elbow joint and with different strengths of those tasks. Although the activation pattern can be assessed with bipolar electrodes, HD-EMG maps could enable the extraction of features that depend on the spatial distribution of the potentials and on the load-sharing between muscles, in order to have a better differentiation between tasks and effort levels.",23216679,10.1186/1743-0003-9-85,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No

Splat feature classification with application to retinal hemorrhage detection in fundus images.,"Tang, Li; Niemeijer, Meindert; Reinhardt, Joseph M; Garvin, Mona K; Abràmoff, Michael D",2012-11-15,"A novel splat feature classification method is presented with application to retinal hemorrhage detection in fundus images. Reliable detection of retinal hemorrhages is important in the development of automated screening systems which can be translated into practice. Under our supervised approach, retinal color images are partitioned into nonoverlapping segments covering the entire image. Each segment, i.e., splat, contains pixels with similar color and spatial location. A set of features is extracted from each splat to describe its characteristics relative to its surroundings, employing responses from a variety of filter bank, interactions with neighboring splats, and shape and texture information. An optimal subset of splat features is selected by a filter approach followed by a wrapper approach. A classifier is trained with splat-based expert annotations and evaluated on the publicly available Messidor dataset. An area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.96 is achieved at the splat level and 0.87 at the image level. While we are focused on retinal hemorrhage detection, our approach has potential to be applied to other object detection tasks.",23193310,10.1109/TMI.2012.2227119,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",No keywords,"Algorithms; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Retinal Hemorrhage; Retinal Vessels; Retinoscopy; Sensitivity and Specificity","['23193310', '18270057', '17948726', '18334427', '22850462', '17610985', '23849699', '18334445', '22640597', '22481810', '20562037', '21757250', '19430906', '17694864', '23192523', '19163945', '23693131', '26474120', '17994417', '16761845', '20699207', '24001930', '24290957', '21926018', '21536531', '16485764', '12906249', '17429484', '25333171', '22915035', '19163470', '14765697', '18632340', '16967806', '17694863', '21095748', '19539518', '15084075', '16761836', '26766207', '20304729', '19541385', '15575412', '20493760', '20202631', '17204445', '26265241', '24579170', '16967805', '22665502', '22421131', '15854840', '20117959', '25255154', '25227028', '19419790', '20643492', '24139134', '25488211', '18632328', '18432467', '16967807', '23838458', '22255696', '26774796', '18002100', '19163944', '25485429', '21096248', '25240643', '21216707', '20187975', '19163943', '26574297', '23515843', '19782633', '26245720', '20363675', '25333191', '25453464', '23314502', '18693508', '21865074', '22255692', '22255697', '25333186', '23367038', '23193315', '21097297', '22255693', '20214432', '19163947', '23367039', '20426207', '25333172', '21198168', '19921335', '31281057', '24238743', '17429482', '24615482', '26563686', '17429481', '17354945', '24636803', '23367040', '20879450', '20177733', '23452930', '21737338', '25333174', '28391812', '19163146', '24579186', '22894504', '23367036', '15377116', '19163948', '15217257', '11929101', '29455260', '22255694', '17945684', '23286156', '20703624', '28700902', '25737098', '29059959', '28198460', '23286094', '24111451', '26240830', '26296156', '26502233', '23807422', '23746595', '17333086', '17429490', '29852962', '22255463', '18003502', '25830353', '25569919', '23366904', '33362147', '23410507', '29059886', '26886969', '29372258', '28268568', '18545537', '30013614', '33104544', '27886718', '27046869', '24111454', '31642771', '25029523', '9357668', '26894596', '25571441', '29204257', '25763334', '9929355', '18002284', '30441691', '25569921', '9604780', '25003153', '22737322', '27191513', '19965082', '27637005', '18003503', '28321264', '19347625', '21509147', '7375087', '10719494', '31679409', '8814392', '35052803', '27668130', '26158021', '31170076', '25405434', '18286099', '37103235', '36513802', '36444209', '36185322', '34997375', '34205120', '32518708', '31144148', '30400869', '30319908', '30262988', '29450843', '29318442', '28560245', '28508191', '27777811', '26953020', '25697773', '25175552', '23193310', '18270057', '17948726', '18334427', '22850462', '24139134', '23193310', '18270057', '17948726', '18334427', '22850462', '17610985', '23193310', '24139134', '23193310', '24139134']"
A system for automatic detection of momentary stress in naturalistic settings.,"Gaggioli, Andrea; Pioggia, Giovanni; Tartarisco, Gennaro; Baldus, Giovanni; Ferro, Marcello; Cipresso, Pietro; Serino, Silvia; Popleteev, Andrei; Gabrielli, Silvia; Maimone, Rosa; Riva, Giuseppe",No date,"Prolonged exposure to stressful environments can lead to serious health problems. Therefore, measuring stress in daily life situations through non-invasive procedures has become a significant research challenge. In this paper, we describe a system for the automatic detection of momentary stress from behavioral and physiological measures collected through wearable sensors. The system's architecture consists of two key components: a) a mobile acquisition module; b) an analysis and decision module. The mobile acquisition module is a smartphone application coupled with a newly developed sensor platform (Personal Biomonitoring System, PBS). The PBS acquires behavioral (motion activity, posture) and physiological (hearth rate) variables, performs low-level, real-time signal preprocessing, and wirelessly communicates with the smartphone application, which in turn connects to a remote server for further signal processing and storage. The decision module is realized on a knowledge basis, using neural network and fuzzy logic algorithms able to combine as input the physiological and behavioral features extracted by the PBS and to classify the level of stress, after previous knowledge acquired during a training phase. The training is based on labeling of physiological and behavioral data through self-reports of stress collected via the smartphone application. After training, the smartphone application can be configured to poll the stress analysis report at fixed time steps or at the request of the user. Preliminary testing of the system is ongoing.",22954852,No DOI,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,"Algorithms; Cell Phone; Decision Making, Computer-Assisted; Electrocardiography; Fuzzy Logic; Humans; Monitoring, Ambulatory; Stress, Psychological","['22954852', '22875251', '22356974', '18440904', '15850120', '26457710', '16282668', '22954855', '20947318', '21965215', '20123575', '31827740', '22954873', '20064760', '29174666', '22614724', '19272856', '17869159', '22113812', '27440466', '15617982', '11347420', '27930736', '16817657', '22500742', '18207716', '15825866', '22287249', '22942061', '19775977', '15537203', '22698854', '12542242', '20801745', '16607817', '30825538', '18234481', '16962296', '16817611', '23415130', '25997272', '25077429', '21095978', '27106584', '22254677', '26736586', '28774441', '35958772', '22954883', '24110044', '23367465', '32033238', '30071643', '24111424', '26357414', '18461812', '18694000', '26265236', '23348030', '16879757', '26621099', '23028461', '23202238', '27602408', '32771674', '36085635', '28445414', '32316370', '27690058', '33500907', '24807972', '38283632', '32498708', '31518253', '30347742', '27003779', '26339283', '25004803', '23806013', '22954852', '22875251', '22356974', '18440904', '29174666', '30825538', '22954852', '22875251', '22356974', '18440904', '15850120', '26457710', '22954852', '29174666', '30825538', '26621099', '22954852', '29174666', '30825538', '26621099']"
A 3D interactive multi-object segmentation tool using local robust statistics driven active contours.,"Gao, Yi; Kikinis, Ron; Bouix, Sylvain; Shenton, Martha; Tannenbaum, Allen",2012-07-06,"Extracting anatomical and functional significant structures renders one of the important tasks for both the theoretical study of the medical image analysis, and the clinical and practical community. In the past, much work has been dedicated only to the algorithmic development. Nevertheless, for clinical end users, a well designed algorithm with an interactive software is necessary for an algorithm to be utilized in their daily work. Furthermore, the software would better be open sourced in order to be used and validated by not only the authors but also the entire community. Therefore, the contribution of the present work is twofolds: first, we propose a new robust statistics based conformal metric and the conformal area driven multiple active contour framework, to simultaneously extract multiple targets from MR and CT medical imagery in 3D. Second, an open source graphically interactive 3D segmentation tool based on the aforementioned contour evolution is implemented and is publicly available for end users on multiple platforms. In using this software for the segmentation task, the process is initiated by the user drawn strokes (seeds) in the target region in the image. Then, the local robust statistics are used to describe the object features, and such features are learned adaptively from the seeds under a non-parametric estimation scheme. Subsequently, several active contours evolve simultaneously with their interactions being motivated by the principles of action and reaction-this not only guarantees mutual exclusiveness among the contours, but also no longer relies upon the assumption that the multiple objects fill the entire image domain, which was tacitly or explicitly assumed in many previous works. In doing so, the contours interact and converge to equilibrium at the desired positions of the desired multiple objects. Furthermore, with the aim of not only validating the algorithm and the software, but also demonstrating how the tool is to be used, we provide the reader reproducible experiments that demonstrate the capability of the proposed segmentation tool on several public available data sets.",22831773,10.1016/j.media.2012.06.002,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",No keywords,"Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Simulation; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; User-Computer Interface","['22831773', '15984685', '18051072', '24332441', '22453637', '27074891', '18002640', '16685855', '18195436', '22203708', '20083384', '19362876', '15344458', '24683969', '16464631', '16685828', '15889547', '19162631', '17946900', '16871729', '23286074', '22830786', '18979764', '17108379', '25227024', '20426216', '18854247', '19525140', '17354707', '17063686', '15850111', '16686030', '17491471', '15896997', '15641719', '24148784', '17354708', '17354861', '20426213', '20588918', '16238057', '17354857', '18979770', '25333179', '15919233', '19004701', '17990755', '16285382', '16764287', '15628083', '18003262', '17354714', '17354852', '17354845', '15338728', '20733218', '24579136', '17117776', '20426166', '17946010', '15742898', '17388190', '16402623', '16566506', '24683990', '16685872', '17354885', '15344462', '15749093', '18003193', '15628085', '18403179', '17390986', '16311065', '18003194', '18672426', '18440268', '19147881', '17427745', '18979733', '16686028', '19931481', '22119491', '23168322', '17354749', '22186712', '19037410', '15344457', '16685995', '16686036', '17633691', '16156353', '18083344', '18044616', '16509374', '15460283', '20349821', '25682219', '21997252', '24893650', '23366915', '25028593', '28376124', '24416070', '23415254', '34097693', '22003750', '23503297', '24090164', '24197278', '24757667', '21626396', '22255945', '21570336', '35768752', '24354542', '15484441', '23893712', '31242651', '23735122', '34282451', '23799695', '37257373', '24385149', '29085906', '23445542', '23685464', '28130231', '35612011', '33382649', '26646417', '37660135', '23165037', '22140657', '29739959', '36852576', '22611384', '24616617', '35371227', '24999485', '24748723', '35186117', '33481778', '22374361', '34868530', '23316110', '23457446', '28783155', '25152851', '34424898', '38194372', '23729836', '24586511', '21614138', '22003256', '35273904', '26131670', '34811064', '33044933', '34780328', '34002092', '25071966', '38250732', '38028338', '35648272', '36772473', '36048319', '35033104', '34780328', '33816194', '31890358', '30352129', '30085283', '29946897', '29163946', '29082240', '29058349', '29049027', '28420871', '27818606', '27403448', '27179367', '27074891', '26900204', '26516082', '26485353', '26392182', '25769030', '24860031', '24790816', '24723531', '24058026', '23744658', '22831773', '15984685', '18051072', '24332441', '19525140', '20349821', '22831773', '15984685', '18051072', '24332441', '22453637', '27074891', '18854247', '18249617', '17990755', '17272022', '17063682', '17022283', '16685855', '16545965', '16402624', '15742889', '15450221', '15376891', '15338728', '12872953', '12715991', '9184889', '9101329', '22831773', '19525140', '20349821', '22831773', '19525140', '20349821']"
Identification of isometric contractions based on High Density EMG maps.,"Rojas-Martínez, M; Mañanas, M A; Alonso, J F; Merletti, R",2012-07-20,"Identification of motion intention and muscle activation strategy is necessary to control human-machine interfaces like prostheses or orthoses, as well as other rehabilitation devices, games and computer-based training programs. Pattern recognition from sEMG signals has been extensively investigated in the last decades, however, most of the studies did not take into account different strengths and EMG distributions associated to the intended task. The identification of such quantities could be beneficial for the training of the subject or the control of assistive devices. Recent studies have shown the need to improve pattern-recognition classification by reducing sensitivity to changes in the exerted strength, muscle-electrode shifts and bad contacts. Surface High Density EMG (HD-EMG) obtained from 2-dimensional arrays can provide much more information than electrode pairs for inferring not only motion intention but also the strategy adopted to distribute the load between muscles as well as changes in the spatial distribution of motor unit action potentials within a single muscle because of it. The objectives of this study were: (a) the automatic identification of four isometric motor tasks associated with the degrees of freedom of the forearm: flexion-extension and supination-pronation and (b) the differentiation among levels of voluntary contraction at low-medium efforts. For this purpose, monopolar HD-EMG maps were obtained from five muscles of the upper-limb in healthy subjects. An original classifier is proposed, based on: (1) Two steps linear discriminant analysis of the EMG information for each type of contraction, and (2) features extracted from HD-EMG maps and related to its intensity and distribution in the 2D space. The classifier was trained and tested with different effort levels. Spatial distribution-based features by themselves are not sufficient to classify the type of task or the effort level with an acceptable accuracy; however, when calculated with the ""isolated masses"" method proposed in this study and combined with intensity-base features, the performance of the classifier is improved. The classifier is capable of identifying the tasks even at 10% of Maximum Voluntary Contraction, in the range of effort level developed by patients with neuromuscular disorders, showing that intention end effort of motion can be estimated from HD-EMG maps and applied in rehabilitation.",22819519,10.1016/j.jelekin.2012.06.009,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No

The 2D analytic signal for envelope detection and feature extraction on ultrasound images.,"Wachinger, Christian; Klein, Tassilo; Navab, Nassir",2012-05-29,"The fundamental property of the analytic signal is the split of identity, meaning the separation of qualitative and quantitative information in form of the local phase and the local amplitude, respectively. Especially the structural representation, independent of brightness and contrast, of the local phase is interesting for numerous image processing tasks. Recently, the extension of the analytic signal from 1D to 2D, covering also intrinsic 2D structures, was proposed. We show the advantages of this improved concept on ultrasound RF and B-mode images. Precisely, we use the 2D analytic signal for the envelope detection of RF data. This leads to advantages for the extraction of the information-bearing signal from the modulated carrier wave. We illustrate this, first, by visual assessment of the images, and second, by performing goodness-of-fit tests to a Nakagami distribution, indicating a clear improvement of statistical properties. The evaluation is performed for multiple window sizes and parameter estimation techniques. Finally, we show that the 2D analytic signal allows for an improved estimation of local features on B-mode images.",22704027,10.1016/j.media.2012.05.001,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,"Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Ultrasonography","['22704027', '21761670', '21129881', '15641731', '19116198', '19409591', '19126471', '18703828', '18432471', '19823243', '17496374', '17108377', '19535282', '16524086', '17117779', '18270127', '15742897', '22287240', '17224613', '16402619', '18467224', '16986550', '20620691', '18713675', '17848784', '20889431', '18270121', '17848772', '15495305', '19116201', '17073336', '17946127', '17093334', '16526434', '17431304', '16485764', '16366236', '18703835', '16520082', '17019864', '16285372', '17108374', '18586616', '18390372', '16402628', '18579943', '20634555', '18000328', '23823414', '24402895', '24968172', '27125557', '18390351', '18979759', '19162684', '24184434', '23366909', '23849387', '18979734', '23286156', '24035660', '18002212', '28279861', '25959057', '23443703', '18815097', '25595523', '22255494', '17441585', '18450534', '17945712', '15055806', '16555763', '16468454', '23938633', '19828227', '17945737', '28392001', '25485401', '17354760', '19163910', '25226986', '19205994', '18002211', '19646699', '19942533', '20799843', '18982623', '19964934', '22124000', '23366913', '30239291', '25014952', '28285340', '16964911', '18002239', '27984513', '29594853', '8772264', '11839403', '26737742', '1766831', '2675450', '10385961', '31456602', '31101443', '26158091', '7785125', '3074550', '25330485', '24787197', '28764533', '3445400', '26264190', '24042812', '30034676', '22704027', '21761670', '21129881', '15641731', '19535282', '20620691', '22704027', '21761670', '21129881', '15641731', '19116198', '19409591', '22704027', '19535282', '20620691', '27984513', '22704027', '19535282', '20620691', '27984513']"
A dual decomposition approach to feature correspondence.,"Torresani, Lorenzo; Kolmogorov, Vladimir; Rother, Carsten",No date,"In this paper, we present a new approach for establishing correspondences between sparse image features related by an unknown nonrigid mapping and corrupted by clutter and occlusion, such as points extracted from images of different instances of the same object category. We formulate this matching task as an energy minimization problem by defining an elaborate objective function of the appearance and the spatial arrangement of the features. Optimization of this energy is an instance of graph matching, which is in general an NP-hard problem. We describe a novel graph matching optimization technique, which we refer to as dual decomposition (DD), and demonstrate on a variety of examples that this method outperforms existing graph matching algorithms. In the majority of our examples, DD is able to find the global minimum within a minute. The ability to globally optimize the objective allows us to accurately learn the parameters of our matching model from training examples. We show on several matching tasks that our learned model yields results superior to those of state-of-the-art methods.",22566465,No DOI,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,"Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Information Storage and Retrieval; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Subtraction Technique","['22566465', '19372609', '19095525', '16566512', '23144034', '18550909', '16355664', '15382655', '16986545', '19443920', '16526432', '15641733', '19762928', '16986544', '17356202', '15742897', '16724587', '18787251', '17848779', '22262681', '15641725', '15641723', '15641740', '22248632', '17699925', '17431296', '15875803', '22128005', '15742898', '15628268', '15641731', '17224617', '17431299', '20479491', '15688566', '18632351', '24951689', '22531763', '22529324', '17496378', '15688558', '23204286', '16526427', '15575412', '17108378', '16986550', '16986542', '17431307', '16468624', '15521495', '20071259', '15688562', '16526431', '15376894', '19372614', '18988949', '22167628', '17431303', '16886864', '16366236', '21690014', '16156353', '16173186', '18511333', '19299855', '17063683', '19586823', '15688565', '22959839', '22529322', '23969380', '23267200', '24951697', '22531761', '24951701', '23549894', '24684000', '17022260', '16830905', '22547427', '24356352', '23743772', '18051152', '23674456', '22481818', '16671292', '23864203', '24356345', '16686022', '16671291', '16028551', '23629858', '17946127', '19000969', '23286126', '23893719', '25333104', '23629859', '17108387', '16519361', '23286118', '15887558', '23969396', '17926703', '20426035', '24216718', '25029458', '24158477', '24579196', '17108385', '23708804', '25248211', '23322762', '17108392', '15747792', '24951700', '26519794', '17357724', '16579382', '25980675', '16477832', '15971773', '23286037', '16830915', '17946927', '15794167', '20426037', '20426197', '24723536', '26353308', '16237997', '25122849', '23070298', '21761668', '17108389', '17044189', '16602600', '17390989', '29065656', '21761694', '21761695', '17784601', '24474375', '16238066', '17153947', '20879348', '24238743', '17926939', '16013757', '18334393', '17108380', '17269627', '15747790', '24604689', '20426192', '16190470', '16985526', '20879334', '20426025', '24723518', '24505693', '21761679', '17945808', '24579155', '18693499', '19162675', '20879356', '23757530', '25320823', '24579128', '20640806', '23286101', '24683996', '29518676', '23979480', '24808619', '24391891', '17990742', '26985996', '24102125', '18220191', '23335663', '18003263', '20879454', '25769156', '20100674', '23035717', '25823035', '16121741', '31104711', '27295666', '28219833', '25617769', '26595921', '24434224', '22806678', '23787339', '23681987', '31567073', '31136610', '25314700', '24871350', '18002087', '32911786', '30295626', '26771830', '25354301', '19965057', '11341570', '24812556', '25751865', '25014946', '26292343', '22006295', '26886966', '28641246', '37027599', '26353337', '26415154', '26595909', '31071040', '25996922', '26656584', '29989966', '35427222', '26539845', '31443049', '31144627', '24231874', '30130172', '22003594', '34216788', '31946898', '26352240', '28708543', '21646677', '10566441', '28500016', '33048675', '26352444', '30843819', '36015753', '24029908', '32750842', '26353007', '25886624', '26372208', '24956538', '30235113', '25073171', '23868776', '34580645', '29346096', '37409218', '27409688', '35895644', '21869377', '15702212', '25576568', '28320667', '27254858', '29989982', '32795965', '25612694', '26353125', '34502643', '34068208', '26766071', '18263531', '24695139', '31144636', '28920900', '20529919', '17270856', '21869030', '26353149', '18276401', '27875140', '26353326', '33825473', '26353285', '10578039', '33804619', '26352627', '28141524', '35205557', '21868995', '34818376', '30079406', '22566465', '19372609', '19095525', '16566512', '26353308', '23787339', '22566465', '19372609', '19095525', '16566512', '23144034', '18550909', '22566465', '26353308', '23787339', '22566465', '26353308', '23787339']"
Acute leukemia classification by ensemble particle swarm model selection.,"Escalante, Hugo Jair; Montes-y-Gómez, Manuel; González, Jesús A; Gómez-Gil, Pilar; Altamirano, Leopoldo; Reyes, Carlos A; Reta, Carolina; Rosales, Alejandro",2012-04-15,"Acute leukemia is a malignant disease that affects a large proportion of the world population. Different types and subtypes of acute leukemia require different treatments. In order to assign the correct treatment, a physician must identify the leukemia type or subtype. Advanced and precise methods are available for identifying leukemia types, but they are very expensive and not available in most hospitals in developing countries. Thus, alternative methods have been proposed. An option explored in this paper is based on the morphological properties of bone marrow images, where features are extracted from medical images and standard machine learning techniques are used to build leukemia type classifiers.",22510477,10.1016/j.artmed.2012.03.005,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,"Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Bone Marrow; Bone Marrow Cells; Hematologic Neoplasms; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Leukemia; Pattern Recognition, Automated","['22510477', '21493968', '16215966', '26107374', '22067435', '20187212', '19336325', '17956879', '18831787', '19110490', '19465863', '15978569', '18195433', '15742897', '18432467', '18779082', '18632332', '18270121', '18713675', '18566491', '19647098', '20172790', '20096528', '19110491', '24273143', '21775110', '18440791', '30351463', '21245006', '20005686', '18787250', '17243588', '18023261', '18617720', '20729173', '19171524', '15465476', '18390369', '19135343', '18672070', '18048398', '17694863', '24642081', '23636746', '24211990', '27835638', '26353379', '29054251', '31256009', '18939996', '24561346', '17521086', '23218914', '20013155', '24806766', '23544367', '37627931', '21194784', '25596242', '26576199', '33343851', '31201595', '23486822', '31319964', '29654425', '32054876', '26221132', '24697596', '22262526', '21326602', '34350848', '36821974', '26660692', '22854976', '21431575', '32721953', '24035745', '19179252', '27754580', '25339088', '23757582', '24306061', '28247304', '30387756', '22255841', '21645638', '21095831', '24808071', '25241903', '27406956', '27951501', '7705904', '22402197', '20865503', '35270856', '29627437', '24733633', '28113438', '11770920', '36172268', '30616096', '28255296', '37812613', '35797327', '32410538', '25700148', '27187989', '28358850', '25262492', '15032079', '37740765', '23186275', '26081904', '24108493', '35336523', '25335972', '21988887', '32011275', '11137198', '32984283', '37167882', '31023253', '32781030', '26221625', '34306177', '35066445', '17118136', '31281338', '25014095', '20734222', '29353216', '14552434', '26737432', '32610614', '24967437', '32635415', '21097362', '19964704', '24044669', '34792573', '26963715', '35663047', '29544792', '21813360', '33342036', '34749635', '31946738', '32633668', '31570774', '20968151', '33302591', '29426855', '38125946', '15136864', '33456763', '24953305', '36126356', '35046459', '34493478', '22645272', '32893918', '27078633', '27449947', '23947227', '19674444', '27315152', '30075355', '27445204', '37611575', '36243045', '21576745', '24806646', '23663143', '36772151', '33210119', '30232632', '29869179', '29038732', '24806647', '29994577', '29740517', '24839351', '31946147', '17181863', '37424877', '23743339', '37090504', '27822312', '32894360', '36617105', '11391939', '24124142', '24886370', '37806057', '33916234', '28634344', '25401180', '25585428', '24986233', '33868399', '32784547', '33057258', '26100717', '18645231', '26599713', '29994111', '30130216', '35350819', '7067375', '31779263', '22811955', '24808387', '27200410', '23000479', '29993956', '23597746', '33392514', '23303001', '25221378', '35187470', '37133056', '34891604', '28072953', '26208107', '21017574', '31650363', '13326622', '13286150', '26824617', '1422897', '29474911', '36284890', '33401373', '32580741', '31728805', '31682577', '31154550', '30283865', '30232632', '29995204', '29880463', '29654425', '29228051', '28812013', '28706349', '22510477', '21493968', '16215966', '26107374', '31319964', '14552434', '22510477', '21493968', '16215966', '26107374', '22067435', '20187212', '22510477', '31319964', '14552434', '29544792', '33342036', '31946738', '30232632', '23947227', '31946147', '36126356', '22510477', '31319964', '14552434', '29544792', '33342036', '31946738']"
Feature extraction with deep neural networks by a generalized discriminant analysis.,"Stuhlsatz, André; Lippel, Jens; Zielke, Thomas",No date,"We present an approach to feature extraction that is a generalization of the classical linear discriminant analysis (LDA) on the basis of deep neural networks (DNNs). As for LDA, discriminative features generated from independent Gaussian class conditionals are assumed. This modeling has the advantages that the intrinsic dimensionality of the feature space is bounded by the number of classes and that the optimal discriminant function is linear. Unfortunately, linear transformations are insufficient to extract optimal discriminative features from arbitrarily distributed raw measurements. The generalized discriminant analysis (GerDA) proposed in this paper uses nonlinear transformations that are learnt by DNNs in a semisupervised fashion. We show that the feature extraction based on our approach displays excellent performance on real-world recognition and detection tasks, such as handwritten digit recognition and face detection. In a series of experiments, we evaluate GerDA features with respect to dimensionality reduction, visualization, classification, and detection. Moreover, we show that GerDA DNNs can preprocess truly high-dimensional input data to low-dimensional representations that facilitate accurate predictions even if simple linear predictors or measures of similarity are used.",24805043,10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2183645,pubmed,Journal Article,No keywords,"Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Discriminant Analysis; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Models, Statistical; Neural Networks, Computer; Nonlinear Dynamics; Pattern Recognition, Automated","['24805043', '23764874', '18270092', '17699917', '15940983', '17131668', '15688560', '16640259', '15943424', '23529087', '16526484', '19336330', '21521666', '16526424', '18550907', '12899257', '18842480', '16886863', '16121739', '24732237', '18195434', '23144037', '18348919', '15130250', '24805038', '15732390', '21693417', '22027372', '24806129', '17714913', '18179076', '18579973', '24806766', '19022731', '18348937', '19497813', '21493968', '29126070', '16468619', '22097255', '17431299', '20044236', '25706895', '17299222', '28198354', '18988954', '22392705', '16526421', '28651080', '18276970', '21257375', '19822471', '16121728', '24210290', '17001982', '20820072', '20089474', '18269946', '16617613', '24819874', '26339229', '11032039', '21075720', '10619251', '24808551', '21062679', '18220199', '15912589', '24805048', '19163881', '32361379', '18269937', '29096201', '28316616', '18541503', '36072737', '25347581', '17051700', '33877998', '21843987', '18263314', '17702298', '19441177', '18390308', '19054734', '20734222', '20602002', '9950729', '24808557', '14757253', '21724505', '20570770', '19000967', '21193373', '27665534', '19095532', '26799292', '27619086', '33667167', '21095864', '24737997', '33422928', '14582888', '16167695', '21803684', '26161960', '19963695', '24657572', '29735249', '7490163', '31063926', '25647667', '32145648', '32877456', '11852445', '18269936', '24222783', '18541495', '18452243', '30798048', '28316614', '16856670', '25112715', '9327275', '17467878', '33502996', '18390306', '18269959', '19273044', '24808374', '32502799', '27911905', '29062291', '25164247', '25886892', '20479503', '18237995', '11718421', '20003274', '26153771', '31021783', '31980101', '28237920', '21096912', '24010269', '30974302', '29181087', '30908247', '9283041', '21724506', '10085430', '33229549', '33261416', '35378803', '18252472', '2009496', '9611784', '26340772', '26448739', '26685273', '18670041', '30388431', '37126629', '33297389', '26547244', '17476326', '26186772', '27893761', '8879092', '33984737', '29994783', '7711963', '28025484', '32889154', '27576267', '33079656', '34314354', '29857712', '28706534', '26703574', '9719569', '30759085', '18238001', '31059440', '25721558', '26394421', '25570026', '24110955', '36033591', '27687329', '8293744', '18255669', '15011278', '34764624', '29154225', '29526849', '34554918', '29993594', '8881318', '23818937', '10085426', '24453791', '24077217', '29940488', '38136544', '9283042', '33385830', '12125897', '15384535', '27071176', '31634826', '28127109', '32166050', '37018309', '30785004', '26415158', '18003234', '25559000', '23584759', '2028130', '24191136', '34691165', '31094699', '7490168', '33375421', '23991036', '35685225', '9719577', '30047878', '34693374', '18255598', '27814465', '9438271', '35333712', '17282392', '19113190', '29625354', '30990447', '26353142', '28186877', '18263402', '22937054', '23735433', '35052161', '12022513', '29990212', '24701144', '30616095', '1768641', '31009070', '27875137', '9040066', '25570678', '33434122', '37747863', '25501718', '18255752', '18255816', '25631569', '12005981', '29295359', '34262223', '35854590', '18267850', '23640791', '8785914', '30263012', '27325371', '29994754', '37845723', '19111559', '22323898', '19182127', '27824585', '35727351', '28734370', '35263258', '9332709', '18255672', '20701090', '35205483', '28991755', '26529787', '31329148', '31144626', '35617189', '25620807', '7564791', '36972227', '35387382', '19169416', '27046912', '34146968', '34264961', '34502644', '26392643', '28163983', '32121939', '21869035', '31272910', '3184960', '18255674', '31193496', '29462931', '24904445', '24039299', '38329856', '33291768', '27330194', '18244492', '21869095', '26915139', '38349830', '26764557', '36456327', '36033587', '20037634', '18235690', '24805043', '23764874', '18270092', '17699917', '9283041', '10085430', '24805043', '23764874', '18270092', '17699917', '15940983', '17131668', '24805043', '9283041', '10085430', '9719569', '10085426', '30785004', '12022513', '28734370', '24805043', '9283041', '10085430', '9719569', '10085426', '30785004']"
Automatic image annotation and retrieval using group sparsity.,"Zhang, Shaoting; Huang, Junzhou; Li, Hongsheng; Metaxas, Dimitris N",2012-01-10,"Automatically assigning relevant text keywords to images is an important problem. Many algorithms have been proposed in the past decade and achieved good performance. Efforts have focused upon model representations of keywords, whereas properties of features have not been well investigated. In most cases, a group of features is preselected, yet important feature properties are not well used to select features. In this paper, we introduce a regularization-based feature selection algorithm to leverage both the sparsity and clustering properties of features, and incorporate it into the image annotation task. Using this group-sparsity-based method, the whole group of features [e.g., red green blue (RGB) or hue, saturation, and value (HSV)] is either selected or removed. Thus, we do not need to extract this group of features when new data comes. A novel approach is also proposed to iteratively obtain similar and dissimilar pairs from both the keyword similarity and the relevance feedback. Thus, keyword similarity is modeled in the annotation framework. We also show that our framework can be employed in image retrieval tasks by selecting different image pairs. Extensive experiments are designed to compare the performance between features, feature combinations, and regularization-based feature selection methods applied on the image annotation task, which gives insight into the properties of features in the image annotation task. The experimental results demonstrate that the group-sparsity-based method is more accurate and stable than others.",22249744,10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2179533,pubmed,Journal Article,No keywords,"Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Decision Support Techniques; Documentation; Information Storage and Retrieval; Natural Language Processing; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Radiology Information Systems","['22249744', '18787239', '18787241', '21193376', '17224611', '18566492', '18617712', '18999165', '22194245', '18550906', '17431300', '18037271', '18270128', '22155954', '16028561', '18787240', '19586822', '19372612', '19083036', '22262681', '22262682', '26890880', '19926897', '24815543', '18421106', '16285372', '16873506', '18998868', '18787242', '18787237', '17627045', '15742891', '22193754', '16886869', '18000321', '18566488', '21592914', '25485415', '17699924', '18421105', '18348925', '16724595', '21296682', '17699925', '19762928', '17848778', '14871877', '16566500', '20350844', '18348931', '18369247', '24273143', '22194244', '15641730', '19116199', '21859616', '20889434', '15495331', '15495304', '18000320', '17846834', '19095537', '22180509', '16237990', '16640258', '21664806', '16640259', '24522625', '24746250', '18188650', '23823416', '25016956', '23757591', '18998802', '16468570', '22874172', '23193319', '16240776', '17385630', '19965054', '16452796', '19024498', '12385981', '22254818', '25246167', '21144707', '22641700', '24565470', '25160368', '25160229', '25160340', '17416163', '31121417', '24860817', '20100674', '17108393', '22585098', '27579032', '25929596', '30475672', '19024494', '16445255', '29329701', '23797314', '25974939', '23892907', '23247859', '24092327', '20670693', '23955754', '18047704', '19546026', '25474678', '26448738', '32750818', '30399159', '26414378', '28219745', '17238458', '23920862', '22575680', '22621237', '22499664', '23940544', '22752134', '24860033', '21383399', '28287983', '18252376', '24977172', '34945976', '24551382', '26339638', '36551149', '28641261', '22929789', '21266315', '27893821', '18282973', '21809171', '23251359', '30678263', '34300388', '26452250', '18244478', '32095790', '25532180', '21079279', '27046897', '23410888', '25794390', '23047876', '27875221', '22641703', '18244740', '28391189', '23674453', '30080147', '18296243', '26560905', '23107059', '25872088', '23890634', '21564262', '36039347', '15908036', '26357345', '35600634', '33015633', '21173450', '29989987', '23201798', '22529326', '32440369', '28459674', '27382243', '24200529', '23805178', '22249744', '18787239', '18787241', '21193376', '22193754', '24746250', '22249744', '18787239', '18787241', '21193376', '17224611', '18566492', '22249744', '22193754', '24746250', '18188650', '25246167', '24977172', '22249744', '22193754', '24746250', '18188650', '25246167', '24977172']"
Local color vector binary patterns from multichannel face images for face recognition.,"Lee, Seung Ho; Choi, Jae Young; Ro, Yong Man; Plataniotis, Konstantinos N",2011-12-23,"This paper proposes a novel face descriptor based on color information, i.e., so-called local color vector binary patterns (LCVBPs), for face recognition (FR). The proposed LCVBP consists of two discriminative patterns: color norm patterns and color angular patterns. In particular, we have designed a method for extracting color angular patterns, which enables to encode the discriminating texture patterns derived from spatial interactions among different spectral-band images. In order to perform FR tasks, the proposed LCVBP feature is generated by combining multiple features extracted from both color norm patterns and color angular patterns. Extensive and comparative experiments have been conducted to evaluate the proposed LCVBP feature on five public databases. Experimental results show that the proposed LCVBP feature is able to yield excellent FR performance for challenging face images.

The biocurator community, as an active user of biomedical literature, provides a diverse and engaged end user group for text mining tools. Earlier BioCreative challenges involved many text mining teams in developing basic capabilities relevant to biological curation, but they did not address the issues of system usage, insertion into the workflow and adoption by curators. Thus in BioCreative III (BC-III), the InterActive Task (IAT) was introduced to address the utility and usability of text mining tools for real-life biocuration tasks. To support the aims of the IAT in BC-III, involvement of both developers and end users was solicited, and the development of a user interface to address the tasks interactively was

Facial expression recognition based on local binary patterns and kernel discriminant isomap.,"Zhao, Xiaoming; Zhang, Shiqing",2011-10-11,"Facial expression recognition is an interesting and challenging subject. Considering the nonlinear manifold structure of facial images, a new kernel-based manifold learning method, called kernel discriminant isometric mapping (KDIsomap), is proposed. KDIsomap aims to nonlinearly extract the discriminant information by maximizing the interclass scatter while minimizing the intraclass scatter in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. KDIsomap is used to perform nonlinear dimensionality reduction on the extracted local binary patterns (LBP) facial features, and produce low-dimensional discrimimant embedded data representations with striking performance improvement on facial expression recognition tasks. The nearest neighbor classifier with the Euclidean metric is used for facial expression classification. Facial expression recognition experiments are performed on two popular facial expression databases, i.e., the JAFFE database and the Cohn-Kanade database. Experimental results indicate that KDIsomap obtains the best accuracy of 81.59% on the JAFFE database, and 94.88% on the Cohn-Kanade database. KDIsomap outperforms the other used methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), kernel linear discriminant analysis (KLDA) as well as kernel isometric mapping (KIsomap).",22163713,10.3390/s111009573,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",dimensionality reduction; facial expression recognition; isometric mapping; kernel; local binary patterns,"Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Databases as Topic; Discriminant Analysis; Facial Expression; Female; Humans; Male; Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction; Pattern Recognition, Automated","['22163713', '30959875', '16948295', '20820072', '15688560', '17702284', '23144037', '19054735', '36072737', '16128451', '35341202', '18348939', '33456454', '24951691', '15971917', '17926936', '29990185', '18270092', '16640259', '18179076', '17699917', '20089474', '18237995', '17299222', '24808007', '15747789', '24819874', '16856670', '32967087', '16903378', '15732385', '22737035', '17431293', '19372607', '20299709', '18348919', '16774678', '24808557', '15971923', '21079273', '20229900', '17570145', '18390305', '31791234', '16366237', '17926699', '16240780', '18348937', '21521666', '24732237', '25008538', '16830904', '24816629', '28866497', '21168511', '19884092', '27807443', '15971928', '18220192', '24163638', '15628264', '15747788', '15460279', '23764874', '24579146', '19726270', '16526424', '17702291', '15943424', '20729164', '22097255', '18270114', '27247562', '33505453', '18842480', '25570712', '33877998', '24222783', '17547143', '21550881', '17283777', '17108382', '18187285', '24356350', '19167865', '23529087', '22831850', '20175497', '18784021', '19366643', '16724586', '19163222', '18566501', '24833593', '17283776', '18779084', '18779090', '33502996', '17131668', '15565778', '19622439', '15619939', '21097381', '16907635', '25415949', '24982970', '24701144', '22127522', '29244758', '24714390', '38052152', '25295304', '25119982', '35590818', '23365559', '33687854', '22778600', '30405708', '24595155', '38139503', '34236977', '37438763', '34097252', '34493922', '34909462', '35857735', '23853667', '35598403', '25295308', '24982986', '29717598', '21671790', '24614890', '24316568', '24415793', '37022423', '32991299', '36366000', '38020673', '23205165', '37867721', '37324172', '32837252', '33434122', '36746146', '25250385', '24077217', '21188284', '23729991', '38287060', '20582334', '36033587', '35437465', '34007266', '31405108', '31248004', '28640206', '26543779', '24316568', '23881125', '23771158', '23552103', '22969351', '22737035', '22163713', '30959875', '16948295', '20820072', '15688560', '25008538', '22163713', '30959875', '16948295', '20820072', '15688560', '17702284', '25210210', '21188284', '17283776', '17108377', '16602602', '11125150', '11125149', '11032039', '22163713', '25008538', '22163713', '25008538']"
Task-dependent visual-codebook compression.,"Ji, Rongrong; Yao, Hongxun; Liu, Wei; Sun, Xiaoshuai; Tian, Qi",2011-11-22,"A visual codebook serves as a fundamental component in many state-of-the-art computer vision systems. Most existing codebooks are built based on quantizing local feature descriptors extracted from training images. Subsequently, each image is represented as a high-dimensional bag-of-words histogram. Such highly redundant image description lacks efficiency in both storage and retrieval, in which only a few bins are nonzero and distributed sparsely. Furthermore, most existing codebooks are built based solely on the visual statistics of local descriptors, without considering the supervise labels coming from the subsequent recognition or classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a task-dependent codebook compression framework to handle the above two problems. First, we propose to learn a compression function to map an originally high-dimensional codebook into a compact codebook while maintaining its visual discriminability. This is achieved by a codeword sparse coding scheme with Lasso regression, which minimizes the descriptor distortions of training images after codebook compression. Second, we propose to adapt our codebook compression to the subsequent recognition or classification tasks. This is achieved by introducing a label constraint kernel (LCK) into our compression loss function. In particular, our LCK can model heterogeneous kinds of supervision, i.e., (partial) category labels, correlative semantic annotations, and image query logs. We validated our codebook compression in three computer vision tasks: 1) object recognition in PASCAL Visual Object Class 07; 2) near-duplicate image retrieval in UKBench; and 3) web image search in a collection of 0.5 million Flickr photographs. Our compressed codebook has shown superior performances over several state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised codebooks.",22128004,10.1109/TIP.2011.2176950,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",No keywords,"Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Data Compression; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Radiology Information Systems; Subtraction Technique","['22128004', '24951701', '19443926', '19372612', '22353403', '19586822', '18037271', '16524089', '22997127', '22531763', '22392702', '18550906', '18617720', '16526427', '18787241', '17431299', '19211335', '22155954', '19372614', '17699925', '18550908', '21189243', '22194244', '18988949', '18617712', '17627045', '18390377', '17224611', '19126470', '17063683', '16173181', '18701400', '17699929', '21997263', '17224612', '16119265', '20215076', '18784031', '15943422', '20729173', '17848782', '21414833', '21659029', '19762928', '19762922', '22180509', '16237999', '16119267', '18276975', '20071259', '15688565', '22249707', '15462140', '19162678', '22997128', '24919200', '23629859', '26441449', '17547132', '24513773', '23192558', '24833593', '24997992', '24505678', '15376924', '16671287', '16948296', '24835227', '22410336', '16764265', '26353308', '25122849', '23267200', '23757530', '25112715', '24820052', '24457501', '23757528', '24051736', '24723537', '27623585', '25258644', '24163631', '29883455', '25475486', '26415170', '25585420', '26353275', '22201066', '28060711', '23060330', '25438314', '25361504', '22773049', '22156999', '33438641', '24879897', '24696649', '25222732', '25794407', '26415151', '22692772', '28749362', '24589833', '24808422', '24051730', '27046897', '24710400', '28293255', '26353055', '25420264', '28559133', '23141965', '18292016', '24111221', '26353288', '22614654', '28920899', '25966474', '24457506', '20020349', '24760907', '23481859', '31442971', '24999490', '30629616', '24457503', '27875223', '23008253', '29993412', '28368819', '27046858', '26761730', '10560761', '29694429', '18285111', '22516650', '18255408', '27886061', '34699359', '18230460', '18282935', '23715317', '26357341', '24524158', '24043386', '11718422', '25974934', '21987557', '30990451', '32502224', '24677037', '28534775', '26595921', '22997267', '26352998', '26353213', '25312925', '27362977', '22575680', '15376834', '35759599', '28320662', '28368841', '24892288', '18319980', '25872208', '22752134', '22345543', '26736361', '20172823', '33735082', '25897986', '28003793', '25167565', '26353370', '34577244', '27455264', '32870786', '22201063', '32272429', '25420244', '22169015', '28114059', '18285088', '24110537', '25643405', '25935037', '22540926', '36772705', '26656584', '35256896', '35251570', '22156101', '33817053', '34208602', '21576750', '24231876', '26353295', '22997268', '29993880', '22262682', '26469853', '26761743', '28650813', '26353347', '26353202', '22003634', '24960104', '35665276', '22064796', '18244832', '26121038', '26352453', '23955764', '26111395', '22203700', '26737218', '26742133', '27656199', '26890872', '27214878', '22801510', '21709305', '26353197', '21173449', '26259079', '25571025', '27046497', '27070607', '34117350', '25330487', '24759990', '25069125', '27295694', '28113308', '23868779', '29994290', '26440263', '23681987', '22614643', '27576248', '37015122', '25373082', '26731637', '25321537', '17281111', '25826805', '26321859', '33621175', '32857694', '26352638', '26372202', '23666108', '29610107', '26479796', '24577195', '18285097', '25051551', '9268822', '29990137', '25420262', '26999150', '31944977', '26353339', '29126580', '22201049', '25871724', '25667353', '27723578', '26849860', '22562754', '26625422', '23674454', '27019477', '26080384', '26742149', '30744074', '26441445', '31562084', '25532183', '27058543', '29111567', '30703019', '26353336', '31905137', '33287058', '36560087', '21700153', '35312621', '33710952', '26270906', '37703155', '24231877', '25879947', '26736379', '28459683', '34847029', '29994192', '36732352', '26955016', '17271630', '29240091', '16539050', '36154095', '26571532', '21614133', '30309184', '30560945', '26495975', '26368566', '26132080', '25978761', '25723177', '25603158', '25470727', '25127245', '24892288', '24595052', '22128004', '24951701', '19443926', '19372612', '26353308', '23715317', '22128004', '24951701', '19443926', '19372612', '22353403', '19586822', '22128004', '26353308', '23715317', '29111567', '22128004', '26353308', '23715317', '29111567']"
Multiscale 3D shape representation and segmentation with applications to hippocampal/caudate extraction from brain MRI.,"Gao, Yi; Corn, Benjamin; Schifter, Dan; Tannenbaum, Allen",2011-11-02,"Extracting structure of interest from medical images is an important yet tedious work. Due to the image quality, the shape knowledge is widely used for assisting and constraining the segmentation process. In many previous works, shape knowledge was incorporated by first constructing a shape space from training cases, and then constraining the segmentation process to be within the learned shape space. However, such an approach has certain limitations due to the number of variations, eigen-shapemodes, that can be captured in the learned shape space. Moreover, small scale shape variances are usually overwhelmed by those in the large scale, and therefore the local shape information is lost. In this work, we present a multiscale representation for shapes with arbitrary topology, and a fully automatic method to segment the target organ/tissue from medical images using such multiscale shape information and local image features. First, we handle the problem of lacking eigen-shapemodes by providing a multiscale shape representation using the wavelet transform. Consequently, the shape variances existing in the training shapes captured by the statistical learning step are also represented at various scales. Note that by doing so, one can greatly enrich the eigen-shapemodes as well as capture small scale shape changes. Furthermore, in order to make full use of the training information, not only the shape but also the grayscale training images are utilized in a multi-atlas initialization procedure. By combining such initialization with the multiscale shape knowledge, we perform segmentation tests for challenging medical data sets where the target objects have low contrast and sharp corner structures, and demonstrate the statistically significant improvement obtained by employing such multiscale representation, in representing shapes as well as the overall shape based segmentation tasks.",22119491,10.1016/j.media.2011.10.002,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",No keywords,"Algorithms; Caudate Nucleus; Hippocampus; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity","['22119491', '17427745', '17354875', '19897403', '23769921', '20879609', '18044560', '23144032', '18003193', '17354861', '18761411', '22305953', '17354774', '17354852', '23260393', '17698403', '24614321', '17427738', '25463474', '17354708', '16686024', '16935722', '19163346', '18675918', '16685849', '26363845', '20426213', '16685855', '17354876', '18051149', '17354787', '15984685', '20529727', '16686056', '29518675', '19694274', '17521085', '15338728', '22856667', '23851075', '22033128', '21195016', '18390346', '16685992', '23664648', '18044594', '18693501', '17633699', '19525140', '12472264', '20426160', '18640069', '19236922', '18979776', '18003194', '24684007', '18982713', '18988949', '15688558', '22613821', '16685995', '22831773', '18982588', '17388190', '20426158', '26983429', '21937343', '17354707', '26755062', '18491536', '22959839', '17354850', '16686035', '22959658', '25333131', '22500924', '17431295', '16686022', '18051069', '20879324', '26874288', '19362876', '20303318', '21097290', '22482643', '24832358', '16685860', '21761662', '26545720', '17427736', '15376892', '20129863', '19071222', '24505764', '26646521', '18051141', '18440268', '23286113', '23286181', '23193309', '25320781', '25320785', '22003750', '27069501', '22354704', '23366390', '22854035', '21833491', '22141926', '25254226', '23286134', '21599975', '22003741', '23286114', '23000788', '24384713', '24977191', '24348738', '24493403', '26930677', '24267488', '35324442', '34819378', '24740247', '30805572', '22162723', '24090312', '36365942', '35271438', '24390194', '34891793', '37770830', '23825898', '35937672', '23685633', '25267943', '36315993', '33079671', '34720402', '24027625', '25302006', '25276852', '22140657', '34291235', '23393618', '36427283', '34520358', '37030778', '35629611', '21437202', '24301715', '35709112', '33743355', '34974910', '35687679', '33044933', '21339849', '33705319', '35165532', '36387997', '34609745', '34341753', '29058349', '26807162', '26740912', '25302008', '25066750', '22119491', '17427745', '17354875', '19897403', '19525140', '26755062', '22119491', '17427745', '17354875', '19897403', '23769921', '20879609', '22499653', '21869365', '19880055', '19801201', '19245840', '18854247', '18249617', '18215953', '17990755', '17674975', '17427745', '15742889', '14585263', '12760558', '12715991', '10534053', '10534052', '9873923', '9101329', '22119491', '19525140', '26755062', '22119491', '19525140', '26755062']"

Statistical feature extraction for artifact removal from concurrent fMRI-EEG recordings.,"Liu, Zhongming; de Zwart, Jacco A; van Gelderen, Peter; Kuo, Li-Wei; Duyn, Jeff H",2011-10-20,"We propose a set of algorithms for sequentially removing artifacts related to MRI gradient switching and cardiac pulsations from electroencephalography (EEG) data recorded during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Special emphasis is directed upon the use of statistical metrics and methods for the extraction and selection of features that characterize gradient and pulse artifacts. To remove gradient artifacts, we use channel-wise filtering based on singular value decomposition (SVD). To remove pulse artifacts, we first decompose data into temporally independent components and then select a compact cluster of components that possess sustained high mutual information with the electrocardiogram (ECG). After the removal of these components, the time courses of remaining components are filtered by SVD to remove the temporal patterns phase-locked to the cardiac timing markers derived from the ECG. The filtered component time courses are then inversely transformed into multi-channel EEG time series free of pulse artifacts. Evaluation based on a large set of simultaneous EEG-fMRI data obtained during a variety of behavioral tasks, sensory stimulations and resting conditions showed excellent data quality and robust performance attainable with the proposed methods.

Classifiability-based discriminatory projection pursuit.,"Su, Yu; Shan, Shiguang; Chen, Xilin; Gao, Wen",2011-10-20,"Fisher's linear discriminant (FLD) is one of the most widely used linear feature extraction method, especially in many visual computation tasks. Based on the analysis on several limitations of the traditional FLD, this paper attempts to propose a new computational paradigm for discriminative linear feature extraction, named ""classifiability-based discriminatory projection pursuit"" (CDPP), which is different from the traditional FLD and its variants. There are two steps in the proposed CDPP: one is the construction of a candidate projection set (CPS), and the other is the pursuit of discriminatory projections. Specifically, in the former step, candidate projections are generated by using the nearest between-class boundary samples, while the latter is efficiently achieved by classifiability-based AdaBoost learning from the CPS. We show that the new ""projection pursuit"" paradigm not only does not suffer from the limitations of the traditional FLD but also inherits good generalizability from the boundary attribute of candidate projections. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets validate the effectiveness of CDPP for discriminative linear feature extraction.",22027372,10.1109/TNN.2011.2170220,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,"Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Computer Simulation; Discriminant Analysis; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Models, Theoretical; Pattern Recognition, Automated","['22027372', '17934224', '23529087', '18270092', '17699919', '15732385', '19110492', '24805043', '17699917', '23764874', '17131668', '23757577', '17848782', '18550907', '18348919', '23568506', '17299222', '16566507', '19906590', '22431525', '18566503', '15688560', '17431299', '15628264', '24816629', '15940983', '16342495', '18566495', '24051720', '15940995', '21521666', '19435680', '16468619', '19054733', '16724594', '18276970', '22194243', '17934222', '15565778', '16526421', '19336319', '18348937', '24356350', '24951700', '18842480', '15943424', '21803685', '19372607', '20089474', '17385635', '16886863', '21693417', '19022728', '21968743', '17224609', '15742888', '24356346', '16358412', '18988954', '16886869', '22042156', '17108382', '16566505', '22392703', '16566481', '16886858', '15565782', '20624706', '17526360', '17431301', '16167695', '32361379', '29096201', '19441177', '21550883', '29317862', '21724505', '24737997', '19000967', '29270197', '24010269', '31063926', '33422928', '24657572', '14757253', '35537483', '18263314', '21096912', '31329114', '28025484', '28841719', '19255652', '18255816', '32746282', '15603165', '21869388', '3184960', '21869402', '34247741', '35797042', '33608593', '30136997', '12662524', '22027372', '17934224', '23529087', '18270092', '17699919', '15732385', '22027372', '17934224', '23529087', '18270092', '17699919', '15732385', '22027372', '22027372']"
Building an automated SOAP classifier for emergency department reports.,"Mowery, Danielle; Wiebe, Janyce; Visweswaran, Shyam; Harkema, Henk; Chapman, Wendy W",2011-09-09,"Information extraction applications that extract structured event and entity information from unstructured text can leverage knowledge of clinical report structure to improve performance. The Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan (SOAP) framework, used to structure progress notes to facilitate problem-specific, clinical decision making by physicians, is one example of a well-known, canonical structure in the medical domain. Although its applicability to structuring data is understood, its contribution to information extraction tasks has not yet been determined. The first step to evaluating the SOAP framework's usefulness for clinical information extraction is to apply the model to clinical narratives and develop an automated SOAP classifier that classifies sentences from clinical reports. In this quantitative study, we applied the SOAP framework to sentences from emergency department reports, and trained and evaluated SOAP classifiers built with various linguistic features. We found the SOAP framework can be applied manually to emergency department reports with high agreement (Cohen's kappa coefficients over 0.70). Using a variety of features, we found classifiers for each SOAP class can be created with moderate to outstanding performance with F(1) scores of 93.9 (subjective), 94.5 (objective), 75.7 (assessment), and 77.0 (plan). We look forward to expanding the framework and applying the SOAP classification to clinical information extraction tasks.",21925286,10.1016/j.jbi.2011.08.020,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",No keywords,"Automation; Data Mining; Databases, Factual; Decision Making; Diagnosis; Emergency Service, Hospital; Humans; Research Report","['21925286', '28241931', '27406024', '26481140', '22922172', '21709163', '26766600', '31977252', '25983133', '28606104', '32696698', '21166962', '22554702', '31426779', '29489268', '27431038', '22151823', '28140627', '26201478', '28606174', '33885370', '21247177', '25961290', '21621400', '22665627', '31226306', '31150777', '31361962', '30902595', '23869395', '27955641', '35101128', '28744581', '22586067', '21987583', '22952381', '22085698', '29241659', '31473365', '27580922', '28425889', '32853217', '23920827', '19909518', '26958189', '26448801', '26347797', '26336667', '26099853', '25451103', '31541973', '29887337', '32142458', '25909637', '22677493', '27052618', '29191207', '31030615', '32294192', '21707873', '26385375', '32387818', '32663739', '25155030', '32872350', '24489368', '21491844', '22038514', '27044929', '27216254', '31103549', '28499136', '26336665', '33059588', '27127603', '19696949', '25863986', '20498514', '21047206', '30848457', '28365731', '31512729', '25886734', '36490727', '23882366', '36491970', '35826086', '36492625', '36491915', '36489850', '36489662', '36487431', '36486219', '36884620', '35773478', '37725927', '37162963', '35939277', '33947365', '33936503', '31319802', '29854131', '29358159', '29089288', '27485127', '25561069', '21925286', '28241931', '27406024', '26481140', '28744581', '26073888', '21925286', '28241931', '27406024', '26481140', '22922172', '21709163', '21489224', '21459927', '20362071', '19965054', '19717800', '19574746', '19435614', '18999284', '18999050', '17238402', '17238385', '16815739', '16135244', '16049227', '15684123', '14728211', '14728153', '12474424', '9929296', '9452981', '8563254', '6793166', '21925286', '28744581', '26073888', '21047206', '21925286', '28744581', '26073888', '21047206']"
Computerized three-class classification of MRI-based prognostic markers for breast cancer.,"Bhooshan, Neha; Giger, Maryellen; Edwards, Darrin; Yuan, Yading; Jansen, Sanaz; Li, Hui; Lan, Li; Sattar, Husain; Newstead, Gillian",2011-08-22,"The purpose of this study is to investigate whether computerized analysis using three-class Bayesian artificial neural network (BANN) feature selection and classification can characterize tumor grades (grade 1, grade 2 and grade 3) of breast lesions for prognostic classification on DCE-MRI. A database of 26 IDC grade 1 lesions, 86 IDC grade 2 lesions and 58 IDC grade 3 lesions was collected. The computer automatically segmented the lesions, and kinetic and morphological lesion features were automatically extracted. The discrimination tasks-grade 1 versus grade 3, grade 2 versus grade 3, and grade 1 versus grade 2 lesions-were investigated. Step-wise feature selection was conducted by three-class BANNs. Classification was performed with three-class BANNs using leave-one-lesion-out cross-validation to yield computer-estimated probabilities of being grade 3 lesion, grade 2 lesion and grade 1 lesion. Two-class ROC analysis was used to evaluate the performances. We achieved AUC values of 0.80 ± 0.05, 0.78 ± 0.05 and 0.62 ± 0.05 for grade 1 versus grade 3, grade 1 versus grade 2, and grade 2 versus grade 3, respectively.

EEG feature selection using mutual information and support vector machine: A comparative analysis.,"Guerrero-Mosquera, Carlos; Verleysen, Michel; Vazquez, Angel Navia",No date,"The large number of methods for EEG feature extraction demands a good choice for EEG features for every task. This paper compares three subsets of features obtained by tracks extraction method, wavelet transform and fractional Fourier transform. Particularly, we compare the performance of each subset in classification tasks using support vector machines and then we select possible combination of features by feature selection methods based on forward-backward procedure and mutual information as relevance criteria. Results confirm that fractional Fourier transform coefficients present very good performance and also the possibility of using some combination of this features to improve the performance of the classifier. To reinforce the relevance of the study, we carry out 1000 independent runs using a bootstrap approach, and evaluate the statistical significance of the F(score) results using the Kruskal-Wallis test.",21096669,10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627239,pubmed,"Comparative Study; Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,"Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Electroencephalography; Humans; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Seizures; Sensitivity and Specificity","['21096669', '22254637', '17390982', '20172805', '17278578', '18003254', '23610456', '19162807', '18002656', '19963450', '19499838', '19162805', '18406490', '17946093', '19162806', '29607682', '17946092', '18701381', '26405922', '21096614', '19162803', '21096343', '21690018', '27177554', '26068546', '28161592', '19162804', '29665725', '27662677', '19162827', '17946094', '17716370', '16871711', '26645791', '21096140', '15876641', '21096616', '19162808', '23567810', '23367091', '18002264', '23367031', '21096618', '25560269', '21096613', '28092514', '18003162', '20404397', '18469727', '19162809', '27093309', '16119262', '16871712', '16817615', '16705270', '16219385', '17651716', '15742887', '18003147', '18002193', '24837641', '17405374', '17156848', '22254735', '19162622', '16967290', '21140292', '17097325', '19555931', '24495469', '17605354', '17946051', '21852077', '18002662', '19963451', '16285389', '19163779', '25265603', '28113594', '19757057', '31046987', '26055162', '18427158', '23367030', '22254591', '19163244', '19163956', '15132516', '16623217', '17278577', '24111106', '18435249', '16376606', '18713697', '21095796', '21096242', '17313341', '17313345', '15742897', '22254346', '19163348', '18003242', '31731060', '19164009', '19965104', '21096347', '22254602', '23366371', '19162869', '23366974', '19162870', '19963958', '22254638', '21096611', '21096240', '24000331', '26737931', '21525569', '19162864', '18003246', '18002679', '18003179', '19162620', '21096400', '18003443', '23366887', '35693148', '16510944', '21096988', '21096615', '18003160', '19162859', '19965072', '23366359', '22254773', '21096990', '26241355', '21198193', '19963981', '18003176', '21096141', '19162872', '24745007', '26737856', '23366998', '18047711', '33882415', '23367111', '23755136', '24961214', '19963477', '23366366', '19963492', '18632361', '25241830', '21096991', '32911809', '24595058', '21096007', '23366363', '20566707', '23527184', '23991036', '30998478', '31137529', '35083329', '27747824', '21096669', '22254637', '17390982', '20172805', '17278578', '18003254', '21096669', '22254637', '17390982', '20172805', '17278578', '18003254', '21096669', '21096669']"
Automatic segmentation of the spinal cord and the dural sac in lumbar MR images using gradient vector flow field.,"Koh, Jaehan; Kim, Taehyong; Chaudhary, Vipin; Dhillon, Gurmeet",No date,"A Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system aims to facilitate characterization and quantification of abnormalities as well as minimize interpretation errors caused by tedious tasks of image screening and radiologic diagnosis. The system usually consists of segmentation, feature extraction and diagnosis, and segmentation significantly affects the diagnostic performance. In this paper, we propose an automatic segmentation method that extracts the spinal cord and the dural sac from T2-weighted sagittal magnetic resonance (MR) images of lumbar spine without the need of any human intervention. Our method utilizes a gradient vector flow (GVF) field to find the candidate blobs and performs a connected component analysis for the final segmentation. MR Images from fifty two subjects were employed for our experiments and the segmentation results were quantitatively compared against reference segmentation by two medical specialists in terms of a mutual overlap metric. The experimental results showed that, on average, our method achieved a similarity index of 0.7 with a standard deviation of 0.0571 that indicated a substantial agreement. We plan to apply this segmentation method to computer-aided diagnosis of many lumbar-related pathologies.",21095746,10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626097,pubmed,"Evaluation Study; Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",No keywords,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Dura Mater; Female; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Lumbar Vertebrae; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Spinal Cord","['21095746', '24746606', '24996841', '23556914', '21096592', '24972858', '20564582', '24683957', '17354852', '22856667', '17340125', '18003194', '19162794', '15789581', '18491536', '23265800', '17354714', '24832358', '18044594', '17354861', '17354845', '16240091', '18044568', '17354965', '17354841', '18046941', '20426187', '28196476', '19963654', '18003190', '20632578', '18979731', '18979746', '24579143', '21097291', '22459443', '17946900', '20426159', '19931481', '18044605', '16689221', '17427738', '19362024', '17022200', '24148784', '20042313', '20211569', '18672421', '17260863', '19734061', '20832242', '20426156', '15691255', '18722751', '16464631', '22254374', '18003287', '17354876', '17354688', '20801696', '19963651', '17354787', '27981396', '26741125', '23999783', '32132652', '24505807', '18979758', '23615408', '23867282', '20879221', '16685828', '18051048', '23260393', '26724926', '18979747', '17178234', '25299433', '14719685', '16871715', '18979738', '16871729', '19964162', '24579148', '20581067', '23367432', '22255478', '23366911', '26445367', '22392057', '20060481', '22003741', '21773868', '26736935', '23179682', '18388207', '23927903', '8059666', '35994969', '22854973', '23149587', '24942983', '30637136', '34517183', '20049623', '20529752', '21047380', '33723476', '31449031', '21748657', '21511436', '18002077', '36086540', '28261007', '27775660', '33514580', '31947286', '35808448', '36983570', '35655825', '33298549', '31571307', '30300751', '29713776', '29163946', '28090445', '27293519', '27159989', '26861655', '26724926', '26445367', '23927903', '21095746', '24746606', '24996841', '23556914', '26724926', '33514580', '21095746', '24746606', '24996841', '23556914', '21096592', '24972858', '21095746', '26724926', '33514580', '21095746', '26724926', '33514580']"

DRAMMS: Deformable registration via attribute matching and mutual-saliency weighting.,"Ou, Yangming; Sotiras, Aristeidis; Paragios, Nikos; Davatzikos, Christos",2010-07-17,"A general-purpose deformable registration algorithm referred to as ""DRAMMS"" is presented in this paper. DRAMMS bridges the gap between the traditional voxel-wise methods and landmark/feature-based methods with primarily two contributions. First, DRAMMS renders each voxel relatively distinctively identifiable by a rich set of attributes, therefore largely reducing matching ambiguities. In particular, a set of multi-scale and multi-orientation Gabor attributes are extracted and the optimal components are selected, so that they form a highly distinctive morphological signature reflecting the anatomical and geometric context around each voxel. Moreover, the way in which the optimal Gabor attributes are constructed is independent of the underlying image modalities or contents, which renders DRAMMS generally applicable to diverse registration tasks. A second contribution of DRAMMS is that it modulates the registration by assigning higher weights to those voxels having higher ability to establish unique (hence reliable) correspondences across images, therefore reducing the negative impact of those regions that are less capable of finding correspondences (such as outlier regions). A continuously-valued weighting function named ""mutual-saliency"" is developed to reflect the matching uniqueness between a pair of voxels implied by the tentative transformation. As a result, voxels do not contribute equally as in most voxel-wise methods, nor in isolation as in landmark/feature-based methods. Instead, they contribute according to the continuously-valued mutual-saliency map, which dynamically evolves during the registration process. Experiments in simulated images, inter-subject images, single-/multi-modality images, from brain, heart, and prostate have demonstrated the general applicability and the accuracy of DRAMMS.",20688559,10.1016/j.media.2010.07.002,pubmed,Journal Article,No keywords,"Algorithms; Brain; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Subtraction Technique","['20688559', '19694252', '20879375', '23286036', '26545720', '19694253', '16967800', '20879374', '15493695', '21776811', '21097379', '25333117', '26433614', '16685958', '18982689', '22722056', '20426052', '19694261', '20879252', '24579122', '18982691', '20879370', '19371788', '19369031', '17354824', '23175165', '24936947', '24683966', '21096646', '19163936', '24683994', '12575879', '24579196', '17354837', '20426049', '21690014', '17354825', '21761675', '17354738', '20426038', '19963661', '17427732', '27260522', '17946463', '18982697', '16696494', '21391266', '17964460', '17633697', '23545176', '17039935', '19965245', '15919231', '17354697', '16860588', '17354694', '19095525', '20426033', '26363254', '19138877', '15382700', '25559889', '16685968', '17990749', '24505757', '21761695', '18979816', '18982707', '17784595', '15919230', '17633701', '25046843', '16685860', '17633739', '17354757', '18334448', '15789594', '16686055', '23556905', '12071616', '16685824', '18982588', '18982681', '17354841', '18044611', '18982690', '17633738', '26210914', '12883168', '20056473', '19694283', '15344473', '25333126', '22255435', '20879365', '23283836', '22878830', '22388864', '24752223', '27338410', '34024967', '21324785', '23105952', '32632348', '31711132', '29353341', '26679328', '26260429', '24951685', '24200484', '38234857', '38191573', '38127979', '38020785', '37970513', '37969113', '37823748', '37634885', '37461570', '37417795', '37274163', '37264435', '37160577', '37139749', '37043772', '36827943', '36711162', '36707693', '36690972', '36338275', '36324649', '36250712', '36161180', '35920116', '35879344', '35810187', '35782273', '35421567', '35320092', '35288282', '35262657', '35239133', '35209753', '35121603', '34854477', '34818611', '34733827', '34712116', '34329447', '34038818', '34034096', '33781789', '33584183', '33532273', '33289612', '33110138', '32992558', '32946378', '32860881', '32733945', '32702483', '32489518', '32446242', '32442637', '32318015', '32265680', '31964863', '31945509', '31752923', '31751356', '31711132', '31446127', '31431633', '31425023', '31259320', '31161314', '31132451', '31059694', '31016808', '30939419', '30777604', '30552481', '30276440', '30140944', '29994091', '29993391', '29984156', '29896582', '29785359', '29753575', '29628186', '29524624', '29353341', '29340286', '29325029', '29302051', '29290025', '29274735', '29261693', '29186619', '29136088', '29107121', '29080379', '28826946', '28821786', '28770039', '28747523', '28655897', '28641243', '28626513', '28603787', '28533050', '28530004', '28371107', '28368016', '28301734', '28270991', '28003242', '27818606', '27816859', '27806019', '27773430', '27730414', '27703783', '27514582', '27498084', '27489875', '27460614', '27376641', '27295656', '27295401', '27046847', '27045845', '27010238', '26982085', '26923371', '26912649', '26874576', '26866796', '26807162', '26679328', '26678299', '26628903', '26571123', '26552069', '26525656', '26484047', '26452275', '26260429', '26236148', '26201875', '26133617', '25935725', '25924831', '25767910', '25576061', '25485410', '25465846', '25451481', '25449738', '25364303', '25346953', '25310815', '25302006', '25261565', '25071959', '25046843', '24951685', '24939340', '24753006', '24717540', '24711485', '24691119', '24595340', '24579196', '24575411', '24465115', '24421175', '24418598', '24338728', '24200484', '24126515', '23999192', '23921101', '23846465', '23739795', '23265799', '21984505', '21146620', '20688559', '19694252', '20879375', '23286036', '26545720', '19694253', '20688559', '19694252', '20879375', '23286036', '26545720', '19694253', '20426046', '20379351', '19694261', '19694252', '19680457', '19535282', '19524478', '19398022', '19371788', '19369031', '19351979', '19041946', '18982691', '18979765', '18672419', '18620117', '18482858', '18445748', '18270067', '18262973', '18244700', '18215923', '18215894', '18044584', '17964460', '17919935', '17761438', '17679333', '17633697', '17560659', '17442522', '17354834', '17354721', '17354690', '17243588', '16967800', '16935722', '16779966', '16685832', '16524083', '16466677', '16275137', '16119265', '16019252', '15963755', '15677356', '15551602', '15501084', '15493695', '15275935', '15050575', '14561559', '14561557', '12906253', '12731097', '12575879', '12071617', '11437112', '11382961', '11370893', '11277237', '10782617', '10638851', '10534053', '9873920', '9873906', '9873902', '9184889', '9101328', '8628891', '8454749', '8126267', '20688559', '20688559']"
BioLMiner System: interaction normalization task and interaction pair task in the BioCreative II.5 challenge.,"Chen, Yifei; Liu, Feng; Manderick, Bernard",No date,"This paper describes a Biological Literature Miner (BioLMiner) system and its implementation. BioLMiner is a text mining system for biological literature, whose purpose is to extract useful information from biological literature, including gene and protein names, normalized gene and protein names, and protein-protein interaction pairs. BioLMiner has three main subsystems in a pipeline structure: a gene mention recognizer (GMRer), a gene normalizer (GNer), and a protein-protein interaction pair extractor (PPIEor). All these subsystems are developed based on the machine learning techniques including support vector machines (SVMs) and conditional random fields (CRFs) together with carefully designed informative features. At the same time, BioLMiner makes use of some biological specific resources and existing natural language processing tools. In order to evaluate and compare BioLMiner, it is adapted to participate in two tasks of the BioCreative II.5 challenge: interaction normalization task (INT) using GNer and interaction pair task (IPT) using PPIEor. Our system is among the highest performing systems on the two tasks from which it can be seen that GMRer provides a good support for the INT and IPT although its performance is not evaluated, and the methods developed in GNer and PPIEor are extended well to the BioCreative II.5 tasks.",20671315,10.1109/TCBB.2010.47,pubmed,Journal Article,No keywords,"Computational Biology; Data Mining; Databases, Genetic; Natural Language Processing; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Periodicals as Topic; Protein Interaction Mapping","['20671315', '18834487', '20498514', '15960828', '20671316', '20671319', '20671318', '18834495', '22151647', '20671317', '20671314', '15960829', '20479501', '27087307', '21342534', '22151968', '18834488', '22151872', '19818874', '27278815', '20704011', '17503385', '27173520', '22848135', '23221176', '15960834', '25659452', '24858490', '21339533', '17620146', '19958517', '15960821', '19501018', '18207462', '22665627', '27173521', '18272430', '26258475', '22580177', '26357317', '20671313', '25510606', '21778557', '24144801', '26525745', '18834496', '15960832', '22295749', '22595237', '22151823', '15960831', '27189609', '15284092', '25218035', '27777244', '25616086', '25796456', '23920587', '15542014', '21208788', '25879978', '15960835', '18834492', '27270713', '18712320', '26941831', '26357311', '16014369', '25935162', '15542016', '27896740', '15033866', '21096556', '15960843', '25448298', '24282506', '22152021', '18834500', '27542845', '27173525', '22151178', '26776221', '28113438', '33167858', '27060160', '27141091', '25810766', '28096894', '26380306', '27524807', '29989990', '30560325', '22151087', '30624652', '27504009', '15960826', '27589961', '22151901', '36734300', '18048123', '27694210', '16799122', '20016491', '27589962', '24349160', '19208158', '21491844', '22285561', '31246951', '26243825', '26262336', '18586726', '27402677', '28742392', '27016700', '18586725', '20815139', '21106485', '26510300', '36050787', '24852177', '35951425', '28935226', '18834498', '37878810', '21303863', '21685052', '21799495', '18001972', '23221175', '18629031', '22151999', '28875048', '22151999', '21975133', '21342534', '20671315', '18834487', '20498514', '15960828', '18207462', '26525745', '20671315', '18834487', '20498514', '15960828', '20671316', '20671319', '20671315', '18207462', '26525745', '25935162', '25448298', '20671315', '18207462', '26525745', '25935162', '25448298']"
Human movement onset detection from isometric force and torque measurements: a supervised pattern recognition approach.,"Soda, Paolo; Mazzoleni, Stefano; Cavallo, Giuseppe; Guglielmelli, Eugenio; Iannello, Giulio",2010-05-26,"Recent research has successfully introduced the application of robotics and mechatronics to functional assessment and motor therapy. Measurements of movement initiation in isometric conditions are widely used in clinical rehabilitation and their importance in functional assessment has been demonstrated for specific parts of the human body. The determination of the voluntary movement initiation time, also referred to as onset time, represents a challenging issue since the time window characterizing the movement onset is of particular relevance for the understanding of recovery mechanisms after a neurological damage. Establishing it manually as well as a troublesome task may also introduce oversight errors and loss of information.",20510593,10.1016/j.artmed.2010.04.008,pubmed,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",No keywords,"Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Biomechanical Phenomena; Databases as Topic; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Decision Support Techniques; Equipment Design; Humans; Isometric Contraction; Medical Informatics; Models, Statistical; Movement; Muscle, Skeletal; Neural Networks, Computer; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Time Factors; Torque; Transducers; Volition","['20510593', '8682529', '20182001', '19409768', '9473842', '20303784', '18551837', '16930965', '19762107', '16317237', '16603798', '17997291', '16377160', '20381322', '17765471', '15183268', '16684619', '19945484', '18585905', '17071088', '16830937', '18996046', '19135343', '8737937', '15628266', '15850114', '16219385', '12669988', '15848265', '22153923', '16218194', '15301774', '15893629', '15376902', '15888522', '20615677', '22982093', '22318476', '21924593', '22226044', '22434794', '22275614', '21317076', '19380125', '21877804', '21893789', '11005945', '21722048', '22377658', '22608279', '9973873', '19878556', '23253449', '21543128', '20851786', '25983133', '20841807', '17945718', '23920702', '22588573', '23822496', '20876027', '21193193', '11005946', '22903004', '23070357', '22361653', '22402277', '7563290', '16419933', '12363297', '25836568', '22444348', '9525038', '19015987', '28391199', '23674417', '17945910', '25262492', '23299264', '20655961', '25658903', '22255819', '9950740', '21703713', '27867418', '20483689', '18824133', '18940775', '8945855', '24110662', '15064201', '20460199', '23366579', '19697696', '23248174', '22386789', '19963575', '19963580', '21435985', '25436224', '10883337', '19163882', '22120773', '9779887', '27089182', '22893443', '10597051', '18002473', '2625040', '24142835', '22954520', '11065332', '18002300', '33501135', '27845677', '23186344', '7972366', '9874151', '19963572', '8541025', '18002434', '20708109', '25571595', '32636436', '23098224', '30763243', '16415971', '28208736', '20582285', '31374693', '10641961', '19963579', '26391487', '28268626', '26017428', '23320043', '24076435', '21095957', '24263055', '26042805', '30441085', '18002299', '25025730', '25401180', '31946802', '25631569', '18249944', '25216477', '18238246', '28534797', '23009461', '30662171', '37070071', '1453785', '15090708', '17243226', '28753975', '25709835', '30669544', '22846269', '21315252', '36501849', '18244785', '25026230', '35009677', '20889414', '22873729', '29677985', '35906290', '34859202', '24721766', '25815452', '36825241', '30282896', '32409747', '34752248', '29794111', '26824617', '37439126', '31848976', '30552553', '26941023', '24846679', '20510593', '8682529', '20182001', '19409768', '7563290', '12363297', '20510593', '8682529', '20182001', '19409768', '9473842', '20303784', '20510593', '7563290', '12363297', '18940775', '23186344', '8541025', '34859202', '20510593', '7563290', '12363297', '18940775', '23186344', '8541025']"
